(1, 4, 'Cinderellaâ€™s Royal Table v. Be Our Guest Restaurant', '<p>The two most popular Magic Kingdom table service restaurants both offer the experience of dining inside a castle, which is the main reason Cinderella&rsquo;s Royal Table and Be Our Guest Restaurant are such difficult reservations to score. In this post, we&rsquo;ll compare two of Walt Disney World&rsquo;s most hyped restaurants to determine which you should choose for dinner on your vacation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note that if you&rsquo;re looking for food photos or specific thoughts on dishes we&rsquo;ve tried, you should consult our&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/dinner-be-our-guest-restaurant-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Be Our Guest Restaurant Dinner Review</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/cinderellas-royal-table-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Cinderella&rsquo;s Royal Table Review</a>. This comparison takes a more holistic approach, comparing the overall comparative experience of each to see how these restaurants stack up to one another.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, we&rsquo;re only comparing dinner inside Beast&rsquo;s and Cinderella Castle. While both also serve breakfast and lunch, breakfast and lunch are dramatically different at the two restaurants (lunch at Cinderella&rsquo;s Royal Table is the same as the dinner menu). A lot of this post will apply equally to all meals, and we&rsquo;ll also offer conclusions about other meals at the end, but the direct comparisons pertain to dinner, specifically.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alright, let&rsquo;s get ready to rumble: Be Our Guest Restaurant v. Cinderella&rsquo;s Royal Table. NO HOLDS BARRED&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/rose-gallery-be-our-guest-restaurant-disney-world.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/rose-gallery-be-our-guest-restaurant-disney-world.jpg?resize=620%2C414\" style=\"height:414px; width:620px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Theme:&nbsp;</strong>Both restaurants are set inside castles, and both make our lists of the&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/best-themed-disney-world-restaurants/\" target=\"_blank\">Top 10 Themed Restaurants at Walt Disney World</a>&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/top-20-themed-disney-world-restaurants/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Top 20 Themed Restaurants at Walt Disney World</strong></a>. Even though Be Our Guest Restaurant ranks higher on those lists, I think it&rsquo;s a closer call than those rankings most bear out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The thematic strength of Cinderella&rsquo;s Royal Table is that it feels like you&rsquo;re actually inside a gothic castle (probably&nbsp;<em>because you actually are</em>), which is really cool. The design is regal and feels lived in, albeit without the opulence that some kids may expect. Don&rsquo;t under-estimate the psychological effect of walking inside Cinderella Castle, going up its stairs, and looking out the windows. I&rsquo;d also go a step further and say the interior is underrated. It&rsquo;s historically accurate rather than movie-accurate, which definitely appeals more to people like me who are primarily Disney&nbsp;<em>parks&nbsp;</em>fans rather than Disney&nbsp;<em>animation&nbsp;</em>fans. Regardless of that, the whole package is awesome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By contrast, our experience with Be Our Guest Restaurant is not that of dining inside a castle. The suspension of disbelief just doesn&rsquo;t work, as it&rsquo;s pretty hard to fathom that you&rsquo;re entering the toy castle on the roof of the mountains when you enter the doors. (Maybe the effect works for kids?) However, it&nbsp;<em>does&nbsp;</em>feel like you&rsquo;re entering the world of&nbsp;<em>Beauty and the Beast</em>, and this is particularly true in the more intimate dining rooms. They&rsquo;re like being &ldquo;on set&rdquo; of the movie, and that&rsquo;s really cool.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/cinderellas-royal-table-fireworks-2.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/cinderellas-royal-table-fireworks-2.jpg?resize=620%2C415\" style=\"height:414px; width:620px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Atmosphere:&nbsp;</strong>I won&rsquo;t beat around the bush: both of these restaurants are loud. Part of this is the inherent design of restaurants designed to the interior of a castle. Another part of that is the natural consequence of restaurants that cater primarily towards families. If you&rsquo;re a couple looking for a quiet and sophisticated date night restaurant, you should be looking elsewhere altogether.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m not a huge fan of the ballroom at Be Our Guest Restaurant. I&rsquo;ve said before that it&rsquo;s like a cafeteria or mess hall, and I think that&rsquo;s the most apt way to put it. The tables are close together, the center of the room is massive, and there&rsquo;s not enough to break up the space or dampen the noise. It&rsquo;s a fancy-looking mess hall, sure, but it still feels like a mess hall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By contrast, the main area at Cinderella&rsquo;s Royal Table is large, but it at least feels more intimate. The space is broken up a bit by multiple tiers, pillars, and other design artifice that works to its advantage. While both have a lot of faux concrete that can make these dining rooms cacophonous, Cinderella&rsquo;s Royal Table seems to have more fabrics that absorb the noise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If we were going solely on the main dining rooms at each, Cinderella&rsquo;s Royal Table would be the decisive winner. However, Be Our Guest Restaurant has the West Wing and Rose Gallery, each of which offer a significantly better vibe. The West Wing can be noisy (something about which I&rsquo;m reminded I should tell families as it can scare small children), but it&rsquo;s themed noise, not just screaming patrons. We highly recommend requesting a table in one of these rooms as they are on par with, or arguably better than, the atmosphere of Cinderella&rsquo;s Royal Table.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/dinner-be-our-guest-restaurant-magic-kingdom-disney-world-040.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/dinner-be-our-guest-restaurant-magic-kingdom-disney-world-040.jpg?resize=620%2C404\" style=\"height:405px; width:620px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Cuisine:&nbsp;</strong>The most divisive aspect of both restaurants is their food. We happen to really enjoy each, but you will find&nbsp;<em>plenty&nbsp;</em>of people who disagree. When it comes to Be Our Guest Restaurant, this can likely be attributed to inconsistency. The through-put is pretty staggering, and it&rsquo;s likely the kitchen is in a perpetual state of chaos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With Cinderella&rsquo;s Royal Table, critique of the cuisine might come down to expectations based upon price. This meal is on par with other Signature Restaurants price-wise, and the food is definitely a rung or two below California Grill, Jiko, or the like. That fails to take into account that you&rsquo;re paying for the in-castle location, as well as meeting princesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you compare either of these to other character meals, there is no comparison. (In fairness, most character meals are buffets, so you&rsquo;re trading quantity for quality here.) The quality of the ingredients, the melding of the flavors, and the care of the presentation impresses at both. We give high marks to the cuisine at both, and taking price out of the equation (something we&rsquo;ll add back in below), we&rsquo;d give the advantage to Cinderella&rsquo;s Royal Table in terms of cuisine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/sarah-tom-bricker-beast-be-our-guest-restaurant-dinner.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/sarah-tom-bricker-beast-be-our-guest-restaurant-dinner.jpg?resize=308%2C470\" style=\"height:470px; width:308px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Value:&nbsp;</strong>This is an easy victory for Be Our Guest Restaurant. Depending upon whether seasonal pricing is in effect at Cinderella&rsquo;s Royal Table and the entree you order at Be Our Guest Restaurant, you&rsquo;re looking at the latter potentially costing half as much (or less) than Cinderella&rsquo;s Royal Table. If you&rsquo;re on the Disney Dining Plan, it&rsquo;s exactly half the cost: 1 credit versus 2 credits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, value is not strictly about menu prices, but the intersection of cost and quality. We&rsquo;d say that both restaurants are close to equal in terms of food quality. We give Cinderella&rsquo;s Royal Table the edge, but it&rsquo;s a&nbsp;<em>slight</em>&nbsp;edge. No matter how much better the food is, it&rsquo;s not &ldquo;better enough&rdquo; to justify the massive chasm in price.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Others may contend that meeting the princesses in a pleasant environment with no waiting offers a significant value. For some, this is certainly going to be true. Are princesses worth $10-$20 times the number of people in your party? We probably aren&rsquo;t the best people to answer that. Honestly, we&rsquo;d rather just meet Beast at Be Our Guest Restaurant (who otherwise can be a tough character to find&ndash;princesses are&nbsp;<em>everywhere</em>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also like that Be Our Guest Restaurant has a la carte pricing, which is the fairer approach for non-buffet dining. Someone ordering the vegetarian option shouldn&rsquo;t pay as much as someone ordering beef tenderloin. We get that this is &ldquo;necessary&rdquo; to ensure every table is filled by parties ordering a full meal, and not just doing a cheap soup or salad to enjoy the ambiance and meet characters. Still, the value difference in meals can be significant, and the price difference cannot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/cinderellas-royal-table-entrance.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/cinderellas-royal-table-entrance-640x430.jpg?resize=620%2C417\" style=\"height:417px; width:620px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Hassle:&nbsp;</strong>We&rsquo;ve made off-hand remarks in this post about Cinderella&rsquo;s Royal Table no longer being the tough ADR it once was. Well, that&rsquo;s relative, as it used to be nearly impossible even at the 180-day mark. Now, it&rsquo;s easier but still not easy. Still probably one of the top 10 restaurants at Walt Disney World in terms of booking difficulty, but you can find tables inside of a month out from time to time. More importantly, you can usually book Cinderella&rsquo;s Royal Table once park hours have been released.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The same cannot be said of Be Our Guest Restaurant unless you get incredibly lucky. Even several years after it debuted, Be Our Guest Restaurant remains&nbsp;<em>the&nbsp;</em>hot ticket in Walt Disney World dining. Now it is frequently the restaurant with no availability even 180 days out, and many a Magic Kingdom itinerary has been built 6 months in advance (without knowledge of park hours) due to getting &ldquo;lucky&rdquo; and scoring a Be Our Guest Restaurant dinner ADR.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Irrespective of whether it&rsquo;s your first visit or fortieth, you&rsquo;d have a hard time convincing me Be Our Guest Restaurant is worth that hassle at dinner. The food is not&nbsp;<em>that&nbsp;</em>good (certainly not much better than Skipper Canteen, which regularly has same-day walk-up availability) and the same ambiance can be enjoyed at breakfast or lunch. With those meals being significantly easier to book than dinner, we have a really difficult time justifying the effort and planning sacrifices you have to make by doing dinner at Be Our Guest Restaurant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I know this flies in the face of the internet hype machine that builds up Be Our Guest Restaurant as a must do, but that&rsquo;s my take. And that&rsquo;s as someone who actually finds the dinner menu at Be Our Guest Restaurant to be very solid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/be-our-guest-statue-fireworks-glow-wdw.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/be-our-guest-statue-fireworks-glow-wdw.jpg?resize=307%2C470\" style=\"height:470px; width:307px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ultimately, there&rsquo;s a reason both Cinderella&rsquo;s Royal Table and Be Our Guest Restaurant are two of the most recognizable and popular restaurants at Walt Disney World. In their own ways, they each deliver in terms of theme, and can make for a very memorable experience for kids&hellip;and even adults like us. We&rsquo;d also recommend both at breakfast for a pre-park opening ADR, as this gives you the opportunity for empty park photos on Main Street. (A more limited opportunity with the changed Welcome Show procedure, but an opportunity, nonetheless.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With that said, each restaurant has its own distinct selling points. Even though both are &ldquo;in-castle&rdquo; dining, the actual appeal of each should differ. If you want an authentic in-castle dining experience or a character meal, choose Cinderella&rsquo;s Royal Table. If you want a meal that more or less captures the essence of&nbsp;<em>Beauty and the</em>&nbsp;<em>Beast</em>&nbsp;or you&rsquo;re simply on a tighter budget, choose Be Our Guest Restaurant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now it&rsquo;s your turn&ndash;if you&rsquo;ve dined at both, vote on which of these two Walt Disney World restaurants you prefer:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/DisTouristBlog\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/805493721642962946/H7dWKNum_normal.jpg\" />Disney Tourist Blog@DisTouristBlog</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taking into account theme, atmosphere, cuisine, and value, which of these two Walt Disney World restaurants do you prefer:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/DisTouristBlog/status/952541459009417218\">8:02 PM - Jan 14, 2018</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://twitter.com/DisTouristBlog/status/952541459009417218?card_data=%7B%0A%20%20%22tweet_id%22%20:%20%22952541459009417218%22,%0A%20%20%22choice%22%20:%201%0A%7D\">Cinderella&#39;s Royal Table</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://twitter.com/DisTouristBlog/status/952541459009417218?card_data=%7B%0A%20%20%22tweet_id%22%20:%20%22952541459009417218%22,%0A%20%20%22choice%22%20:%202%0A%7D\">Be Our Guest Restaurant</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://twitter.com/DisTouristBlog/status/952541459009417218\">Vote</a>597 votes&bull;4 days left</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?in_reply_to=952541459009417218\">&nbsp;1010 Replies</a></li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/retweet?tweet_id=952541459009417218\">&nbsp;22 Retweets</a></li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/like?tweet_id=952541459009417218\">&nbsp;55 likes</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://support.twitter.com/articles/20175256\">Twitter Ads info and privacy</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This should be an interesting showdown.

(2, 4, 'Paid FastPass+ for Club Level at Disney World: Thoughts & Info', '<p>Rumors have been floating around for years that Walt Disney World would attempt to monetize FastPass+. These gained momentum last year with the successful rollout of MaxPass at Disneyland, at which point we predicted that it was only a matter of time before Walt Disney World saw some sort of hybrid free/paid FastPass+ service. Well, that time is now upon us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walt Disney World has confirmed that beginning January 12, 2018, guests staying in rooms at select Walt Disney World resort hotels that are eligible for Disney Signature Services (meaning Club Level, plus the Poly Bungalows, Cascade Cabins, and Swan/Dolphin Suites) and who have purchased a 3-day or longer theme park ticket or Annual Pass are able to purchase a new &ldquo;theme park extra&rdquo; for $50 plus tax per guest per day as part of a limited pilot program. Since Disney has yet to give this an official name, we&rsquo;ll call it VIP FastPass+.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These guests will receive the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Three additional FastPass+ selections per day.</li>\r\n	<li>Ability to reserve these three additional FastPass+ selections in more than one theme park when a valid Park Hopper option is also purchased.</li>\r\n	<li>Booking window of up to 90 days in advance for these three additional FastPass+ selections and the ability to book them at multiple top-tier attractions.</li>\r\n	<li>Preferred viewing location for nighttime spectaculars, one per day, including Happily Ever After at Magic Kingdom, IllumiNations: Reflections of Earth at Epcot, Fantasmic! at Disney&rsquo;s Hollywood Studios, and Rivers of Light at Disney&rsquo;s Animal Kingdom.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>All theme park Guests with valid theme park admission continue to receive up to three FastPass+ selections at a single park per day at no extra charge, as well as additional day-of in-park selections that may be reserved and redeemed one-at-a-time after those initial three selections are redeemed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/dumbo-sun-flare1.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/dumbo-sun-flare1.jpg?resize=620%2C410\" style=\"height:410px; width:620px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This news has been met with an extreme negative reaction by many long-time Walt Disney World fans. Most of this has been directed at FastPass+ availability, and worries that Avatar Flight of Passage, Frozen Ever After, Seven Dwarfs Mine Train, and other highly coveted FastPass+ attractions will now have nothing at the 60 day mark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While we think this general sentiment is warranted, we don&rsquo;t believe the specific worry about FastPass+ availability for specific attractions is. Even with a 100% adoption rate by guests staying Club Level (and there&rsquo;s no way it&rsquo;ll be anywhere close to that&ndash;more like 10% to 20% at best), the FastPass+ pool for each popular attraction is exponentially larger than the total pool of Club Level guests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Daily attraction capacity (and, to the point, the percentage of that capacity allocated to FastPass+) is simply&nbsp;<em>way&nbsp;</em>higher than the number of eligible rooms that can purchase this upcharge. If you booked your FastPass+ early in the morning at the 60-day mark before, you should have roughly the same results now. You won&rsquo;t notice a difference, but perhaps those booking at the 55-day window will notice a minor one&ndash;and even that&rsquo;s a stretch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The real problem lies in the future. This is a pilot program, and if successful it most certainly will not be confined to just a small subset of all Walt Disney World guests. The next logical step would be all Deluxe Resort and Disney Vacation Club guests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once rolled out to those tiers, the impact could be more pronounced. While not a clean comparison, we only need to look to MaxPass, which&nbsp;<em>has&nbsp;</em>negatively affected regular Disneyland guests. Not to the point that it&rsquo;s blatantly noticeable, but it is apparent if you do a side-by-side comparison (which we&rsquo;ve done&ndash;and that results in about 3-4 fewer FastPasses in a given day).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The reason it&rsquo;s not a clean comparison is because MaxPass is $10 per day or $75 for the life of an Annual Pass, and available to everyone on a day-by-day basis. Quite simply, cost is going to be a significant barrier to entry for the VIP FastPass+ service as compared to MaxPass, since the &ldquo;cheapest&rdquo; per person buy in for these extra FastPasses is $150.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, we could see this making an Avatar Flight of Passage FastPass+ more difficult to score at some point down the road. Not enough that we have any immediate sense of fear or outrage, but enough that we have vague concerns about what else will be unveiled ahead of Star Wars: Galaxy&rsquo;s Edge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/grand-floridian-dusk-aerial-wdw.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/grand-floridian-dusk-aerial-wdw.jpg?resize=620%2C414\" style=\"height:414px; width:620px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Speaking even more broadly than just these VIP FastPass+, this should be concerning because it&rsquo;s part of a trend in the last several years towards more and more upcharge offerings at Walt Disney World.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/disney-world-upcharge-worth-it-reviews/\" target=\"_blank\">We&rsquo;ve graded some of these Walt Disney World &ldquo;Enchanted Extras&rdquo;</a>&nbsp;in the past and discussed how many felt like they were hastily put together without regard for value.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When viewed in isolation, most of these new upcharges are ostensibly defensible. In certain situations, regular guests might have compelling rationale to use X or Y service, splurge on a dessert party, etc. The individual offering, by itself, does not detrimentally impact the overall experience of other guests to a significant degree.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, once you step back and look at all of these recent upcharges, it&rsquo;s easier to see how their aggregate effect does burden the normal park-goer&rsquo;s experience. There are fewer good seating areas for parades and fireworks, less FastPass+ availability, new surcharge transportation offerings are introduced instead of fixing the broken legacy ones, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To be sure, not all of these new services Walt Disney World has introduced are bad or blatant cash grabs. To the contrary,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/minnie-van-review-tips/\" target=\"_blank\">we are fans of things like Minnie Vans</a>&nbsp;(even though the service isn&rsquo;t for everyone), and find some Enchanted Extras to be all upside (things such as Behind the Scenes tours, certain culinary experiences, etc) that don&rsquo;t at all detract from others&rsquo; experiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beyond that, there&rsquo;s the simple fact that Disney is investing billions of dollars into Walt Disney World right now, and the amount of money being dumped into the parks between now and 2021 is fairly unprecedented. If a few minimally-intrusive upcharges aimed at affluent guests are what it takes to help fund (obviously this is an oversimplification of the process, but you get the idea) new stuff for all, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For me, the problem lies in the upcharge offerings that have the potential to significantly impede or dilute &ldquo;standard&rdquo; theme park admission, or stratify the theme park experience to an unsavory degree.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/sonny-eclipse-cosmic-rays.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/sonny-eclipse-cosmic-rays.jpg?resize=620%2C419\" style=\"height:418px; width:620px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately, I fear that&rsquo;s what will ultimately happen with off-site guests and locals. We&rsquo;ve said it before, but we&rsquo;ll reiterate: Walt Disney World is a hotel business that happens to also operate theme parks. This might seem counter-intuitive since most fans view the four theme parks as the heart and soul of Walt Disney World, but the more lucrative portion of the business is the hotels and the guest spending those hotel stays drive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walt Disney World has made a concerted effort to get more people to stay on-site, and that has largely been successful. Hotel occupancy has crept up over the last several years to the point where many seasons are close to full occupancy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is why we&rsquo;ve seen Walt Disney World on-site perks extended to the Disney Springs Resort Area, and we&rsquo;d expect Disney to find new ways of nudging guests even more towards Disney-owned and affiliated hotels. Increasing per guest spending is one of the next logical steps, and is accomplished via similar initiatives. Expect to see more like VIP FastPass+ as we draw closer to the opening of Star Wars: Galaxy&rsquo;s Edge. Not all at once, as the aggregate impact of that is more likely to be met with outrage, but little by little.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, this prediction is made in a vacuum without regard for greater economic conditions. We already discussed this at length on&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/best-year-disney-world-vacation/2/\" target=\"_blank\">Page 2 of our&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Should You Visit in 2018 or Wait?&rdquo;</em></a>&nbsp;post, but Walt Disney World is benefitting right now from a strong economy and high consumer confidence, both of which are drivers of travel spending.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Add a hot property like Star Wars: Galaxy&rsquo;s Edge to the mix, and the sky is the limit on what upcharges are introduced, and even how base pricing creeps up. Remove that hot economy (as could very likely occur before the end of 2019), and the equation changes considerably. The good news is that we don&rsquo;t think these upcharges and price increases are sustained indefinitely. They very well might be sustainable through the opening of Star Wars: Galaxy&rsquo;s Edge, but at some point, a course correction is due&ndash;perhaps one is already overdue. The bad news is that we&rsquo;ve been wrong with these predictions in the past.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ultimately, this is a long and rambling way of saying that you shouldn&rsquo;t necessarily be outraged by this&nbsp;<em>specific</em>&nbsp;upcharge offering, but you should be concerned about what it represents, and the overarching trend. That is, unless you&rsquo;re super-duper wealthy; in which case, Walt Disney World will welcome you with open arms and make your experience as stress-free and frictionless as possible!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Planning a Walt Disney World trip?

(3, 4, 'Photos & Thoughts: Beach Clubâ€™s New Rooma', '<p>Disney&rsquo;s Beach Club Resort has redesigned rooms, which are one component of a significant multi-year improvements to make this Walt Disney World hotel (and its sister resort, Yacht Club) more appealing to convention guests. In this post, we&rsquo;ll discuss the new rooms, share some photos, and offer thoughts on the changes at Beach Club.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These &ldquo;new&rdquo; rooms at Beach Club were actually completed prior to the Yacht Club refurbishment starting, around early 2017, I believe. My original intent was to write about them immediately after our trip last fall, but I forgot. At this point, I wasn&rsquo;t quite sure whether to just plug them into our existing Beach Club Review as an update, or post them here as a quick new post.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ultimately, I decided to do this because I figured a long and rambling tangent about the redesign was better suited to its own post&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I first walked into the new room at Beach Club, I was almost immediately turned off. It felt like yet another room at Walt Disney World that had all of its character removed during its room renovations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ve discussed the balance of theme and luxury in these Walt Disney World room redesigns countless times already, so I won&rsquo;t rehash all of that here. Suffice to say, it&rsquo;s a tough line to toe, and I think the results have been very mixed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/beach-club-resort-hotel-room-disney-world-629.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/beach-club-resort-hotel-room-disney-world-629.jpg?resize=620%2C411\" style=\"height:411px; width:620px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In my estimation, the new room at Beach Club looked pretty nice, but my main thought was how generic and bland it looked. If this were a hotel room in a mid to high end hotel in a Florida or California beach city, I&rsquo;d be fine with it. Maybe not at the same price points as Beach Club&rsquo;s, but close to them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With Beach Club, one of the best-themed resorts in all of Walt Disney World, I expected more. The modern art is not as charming as the artwork found in the room before, there aren&rsquo;t any touches of whimsy (like the old lamps), and the new style doesn&rsquo;t really feel like an extension of the resort&rsquo;s overarching theme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/beach-club-resort-hotel-room-disney-world-626.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/beach-club-resort-hotel-room-disney-world-626.jpg?resize=326%2C470\" style=\"height:470px; width:326px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>That last item probably best gets to the crux of my issue with this&ndash;and a lot of&ndash;the hotel redesigns at Walt Disney World. Most Disney resorts are themed to a different&nbsp;<em>time</em>&nbsp;and place, and most of these redesigns have aimed at being lightly themed to a different place, but always in a modern style.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the previous iteration of the Beach Club rooms, the room felt like something belonging to a bygone era. There were aspects that were arguably dated, but most of it was timeless. Some of the furniture included lattice that mirrored the exterior, and patterns similar to what&rsquo;s in the common areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/beach-club-resort-hotel-room-disney-world-625.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/beach-club-resort-hotel-room-disney-world-625.jpg?zoom=1.25&amp;resize=620%2C422\" style=\"height:421px; width:620px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, after thinking on it a bit longer, I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;m being totally reasonable here. While I think the style is overly bland, there is also an undeniable quality to it. There&rsquo;s a certain texture and depth to everything&ndash;from the headboard to the carpet&ndash;that offers a sense of luxury.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The furniture is high quality, the lighting is good, there are plenty of nice touches (like the trim and tile work), and the color palette works pretty well. I especially like the little wooden thing on the nightstand, which reminds me of the lifeguard tower on the old lamps. (Maybe that&rsquo;s the intent&hellip;maybe not?)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/beach-club-resort-hotel-room-disney-world-627.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/beach-club-resort-hotel-room-disney-world-627.jpg?resize=345%2C470\" style=\"height:470px; width:345px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>My critique above is, in essence, that it should have a few thematic flourishes swapped out to make it more befitting of the time and place found in common areas at Beach Club. However, if so much about the room works so well and it feels like a high quality room, should little things like a bed runner or wall art really be enough to undermine all of that?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s not entirely a rhetorical question. On the one hand, it seems silly to let a few little things spoil what is otherwise a nice upgrade to make these rooms more well-appointed and befitting of their high prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the other hand, Disney is all about those details. I could maybe give the modern tone a pass (after all, that&rsquo;s what many conventioneers and luxury travelers want) if there was just a bit more to tie the room together and give it character. It just feels to me like there&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>something&nbsp;</em>missing&ndash;I can&rsquo;t quite put my finger on what&ndash;that gives the best Walt Disney World rooms an inviting, charming quality.&nbsp;Maybe I&rsquo;m crazy, or over-analyzing the new rooms. I don&rsquo;t really know.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ultimately, whether my quibbles with the new rooms at Beach Club are right or wrong is a bit of a moot point for us. We still absolutely love Beach Club&nbsp;<em>on the whole</em>, and these changes wouldn&rsquo;t be enough to stop us from staying here (to the contrary, Sarah likes the room more now). This is still one of the most pleasant resorts at Walt Disney World, with a laid back atmosphere and wonderful theming in the common areas. I think it&rsquo;d be nice if the rooms were an extension of that, but perhaps I&rsquo;m an old man shaking my fist at the clouds in this scenario.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Planning a Walt Disney World trip?

(4, 14, 'Why Every Fan Should Visit Walt Disney Family Museum', '<p>Walt Disney Family Museum in San Francisco, California&rsquo;s Golden Gate&nbsp;National Recreation Area is a beautiful, powerful, and humanizing tribute to the Walt Disney. In this post, we&rsquo;ll present a photo tour of WDFM, provide information about its exhibits, and cover why it&rsquo;s a bucket list-worthy experience for Disney fans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your initial reaction to the notion of a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://waltdisney.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Walt Disney Family Museum</a>&nbsp;might be that it&rsquo;s a neat idea, but not enough to convince you to take a trip to San Francisco when Walt Disney Presents at Disney&rsquo;s Hollywood Studios or Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln at Disneyland offer sufficient exhibits on the life of Walt Disney. As we&rsquo;ll cover in this post, neither of those (or any other Walt Disney exhibits anywhere, for that matter) hold a candle to the Walt Disney Family Museum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In our&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/disneyland-planning-guide/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Disneyland Planning Guide</strong></a>, we&rsquo;ve implored those who consider Walt Disney World their home park to visit the West Coast parks if they have the time and financial means. This is due to the way Disneyland &ldquo;oozes history&rdquo; and since it&rsquo;s the only park Walt Disney personally walked, among other reasons. Well, you could say Disneyland is something of a gateway drug with Walt Disney Family Museum being the more serious stuff. (There&rsquo;s a reason many fans say they&rsquo;re Disney addicts!)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While we don&rsquo;t buy into the notion that there are any prerequisites for being a serious or real Disney fan (other than considering yourself one), we do think that any self-described serious Disney fan will love the Walt Disney Family Museum. Simply put, Disney fans will leave WDFM with greater admiration for the company&rsquo;s founder and deeper appreciation for what he created.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;d actually go one further: that just about anyone will enjoy the Walt Disney Family Museum. It&rsquo;s truly an experience with universal appeal, for all ages and interests. The presentation and quality of the museum are far above what you&rsquo;d expect for a &ldquo;niche&rdquo; museum like this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Given how many cynics there are who view the Disney Parks as crass commercialism, a tourist trap, etc., this might seem like a bold proclamation. However, the Walt Disney Family Museum is operated by the Disney family, not the Walt Disney Company. (The latter has loaned several materials from its Archives, and is a regular benefactor of the museum.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WDFM is a&nbsp;501(c)(3) non-profit that was founded by Walt&rsquo;s daughter, Diane Disney Miller, and is operated by people who are passionate for sharing the history and legacy of Walt Disney, the &ldquo;American Original&rdquo; as a person.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/walt-disney-family-museum-adventures-by-disney-san-francisco-long-weekend-020.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/walt-disney-family-museum-adventures-by-disney-san-francisco-long-weekend-020.jpg?resize=620%2C414\" style=\"height:414px; width:620px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>All of this is abundantly clear while walking through the exhibits. Rather than attempting to elevate Walt Disney to a mythical status, as the company is prone to do, the Walt Disney Family Museum seeks to humanize him and to tell his story.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To be sure, there&rsquo;s plenty of celebrating his accomplishments and creative legacy (how could you&nbsp;<em>not</em>?!), but it never devolves into fawning idolization; it always feels real and authentic. This is true even in the museum&rsquo;s lobby, which is a veritable trophy room.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rather than playing up how super important Walt Disney was, this showcase puts Oscars on display next to an award for &ldquo;greatest contribution ever made to the sport of racing pigeons.&rdquo; In so doing, this tongue-in-cheek move actually underscores just how Walt Disney made an indelible impact for countless individuals, far and wide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/walt-disney-family-museum-san-francisco-california-889.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/walt-disney-family-museum-san-francisco-california-889.jpg?zoom=1.25&amp;resize=620%2C394\" style=\"height:394px; width:620px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walt Disney Family Museum begins with a detailed look at Walt&rsquo;s upbringing in the Midwest, military service in France, move to Hollywood, and more. This was by far the deepest dive I had seen into these portions of his early years, which are often glossed over as trials and tribulations of his early life in his successful pursuit of the American Dream.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was refreshing to see this portion of Walt&rsquo;s life thoroughly detailed rather than just what he had to &lsquo;overcome&rsquo; as part of a feel-good narrative arc. There&rsquo;s plenty of material on the Alice Comedies, what Walt wanted to do versus what was commercially successful, and early advertising work he did, among many other things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These first several exhibits also covered Walt marrying and becoming a father, and in greater detail than simply using these facts to establish him as a family man.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/walt-disney-family-museum-adventures-by-disney-san-francisco-long-weekend-026.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/walt-disney-family-museum-adventures-by-disney-san-francisco-long-weekend-026.jpg?resize=620%2C414\" style=\"height:414px; width:620px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Steamboat Willie&nbsp;</em>is featured here, with its expensive technology and difficult production highlighted. There&rsquo;s also a huge collection of early Mickey Mouse merchandise, and exhibits explaining how merchandising deals basically kept the company afloat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For roughly the first half of the museum, these exhibits continue in chronological order (<a href=\"https://waltdisney.org/galleries#!\" target=\"_blank\">you can see the full listing on the museum&rsquo;s official site here</a>). The museum also shines a spotlight on some of the other animators (namely, Walt&rsquo;s Nine Old Men) who helped build the nascent animation company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These exhibits feature a lot animation up until Walt Disney&rsquo;s big breakthrough with&nbsp;<em>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.&nbsp;</em>After that, it&rsquo;s mostly chronological, but you also start seeing more of a topical breakdown (nature, theme parks, patriotism, etc.).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/walt-disney-family-museum-san-francisco-california-893.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/walt-disney-family-museum-san-francisco-california-893.jpg?resize=620%2C412\" style=\"height:412px; width:620px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are even some attention given to some controversial moments, such as the 1941 Disney Animators&rsquo; Guild Strike. While a pro-Disney slant here is arguable (we&rsquo;re not experts on the topic), it feels deferential to the plight of the animators, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walt Disney Family Museum&rsquo;s penultimate exhibit is &ldquo;Disneyland &amp; Beyond.&rdquo; As much as I enjoyed everything that came before it, this was my favorite area of the museum. From models to Audio Animatronics to posters and more, there was a ton to see.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/walt-disney-family-museum-san-francisco-california-894.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/walt-disney-family-museum-san-francisco-california-894.jpg?zoom=1.25&amp;resize=620%2C330\" style=\"height:330px; width:620px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most impressive of all, and where I spent an obscene amount of time was the large Disneyland model in the center of the room. &ldquo;Yawn&rdquo; you might think, you&rsquo;ve seen this before in the Great Moments lobby. You have never seen anything like this. It&rsquo;s what I call &ldquo;The Disneyland That Never Was, And Always Will Be&rdquo; model, with a veritable highlight reel of attractions grafted onto it. Many of these never coexisted, but I sure wish they did.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This Disneyland model changes from day to night and has various Easter Eggs. You&rsquo;ll want to give yourself plenty of time to walk around its perimeter and admire its many details. This is the coolest theme park model I&rsquo;ve ever seen. It was the highlight of a highlight reel exhibit. I left the sprawling Disneyland &amp; Beyond exhibit with an unbridled sense of glee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/walt-disney-family-museum-san-francisco-california-898.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/walt-disney-family-museum-san-francisco-california-898.jpg?zoom=1.25&amp;resize=620%2C381\" style=\"height:380px; width:620px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I don&rsquo;t know if my emotions have ever turned on as tight of a dime as they did going from that exhibit to &ldquo;Remembering Walt Disney.&rdquo; If the lobby awards showcase offered a glimpse at the lives Walt touched, this hammers that point home with the sense of loss felt around the world when he passed. It&rsquo;s a bit somber, but that quickly gives way to optimism as the exhibits pivot to Walt&rsquo;s creative legacy and the impact he continues to make generations later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now that we are several generations removed from Walt Disney&rsquo;s passing, this final exhibit is probably the most important of the bunch. Millennials and young kids might not have any knowledge of Walt Disney beyond the name at the front of their favorite films; this final gallery elucidates what he meant to the world, and his significance. As a Disney fan, this was powerful stuff, and a fitting cap to a museum that absolutely blew me away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/walt-disney-family-museum-san-francisco-california-896.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/walt-disney-family-museum-san-francisco-california-896.jpg?zoom=1.25&amp;resize=620%2C225\" style=\"height:224px; width:620px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even if we were not Disney fans, we would&rsquo;ve been impressed by the Walt Disney Family Museum. As any museum celebrating Walt Disney should, it has a creative flare and production value rivaling some of the best children&rsquo;s museums we&rsquo;ve ever visited. From the type of medical ambulance Walt drove in the war to a variety of animation techniques brought to life, this museum utilizes myriad types of mixed media to tell Walt&rsquo;s story in vivid detail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It excels from the fact that neither the details is balanced expertly with the vividness. Often, museums that are flashy are devoid of substance, and those that are densely informative are dry or difficult to digest. Neither are the case here, and while the sheer joy we had in perusing the museum likely is tied to our enthusiasm for the subject matter, the quality of the museum&rsquo;s presentation is undeniable. I&rsquo;d rank this among the United States&rsquo; elite museums even if I were Neal Gabler.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/walt-disney-family-museum-san-francisco-california-892.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/walt-disney-family-museum-san-francisco-california-892.jpg?zoom=1.25&amp;resize=620%2C421\" style=\"height:420px; width:620px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Given that San Francisco is a 7-hour drive from Anaheim, visiting the Walt Disney Family Museum as a Disneyland day trip is not feasible. Instead, we&rsquo;d recommend doing both as part of a California road trip, flying into San Diego or Los Angeles, doing a one-way rental car, and working your way north along Pacific Coast Highway through Big Sur before arriving in San Francisco and departing from from one of the Bay Area airports.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alternatively, if you have over a week, starting in Los Angeles (or San Francisco) and doing this as a loop works well. Take Pacific Coast Highway through the beach cities one way, and then go inland, hitting Sequoia, Kings Canyon, and Yosemite National Parks the other direction. We&rsquo;ve done this both ways, and minus the stretches through the middle of California (<em>ugh&hellip;Bakersfield</em>), this is one of the best imaginable road trips.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regardless of how you do this trip, Walt Disney Family Museum is an incredible experience for anyone, and also a moving experience for Disney fans. Thanks to its rotating temporary exhibition spotlighting other animators, it&rsquo;s also one we&rsquo;re sure to revisit annually. (If we lived in the Bay Area, we&rsquo;d go more than that. We&rsquo;d get Annual Passes&ndash;<em>that&nbsp;</em>is how much we loved it.)&nbsp;It&rsquo;s sure to give you a greater respect for Walt&rsquo;s humble beginnings and the empire he built, and greater respect for what he created&ndash;and his creative vision. Beyond that, WDFM offers a humanizing depiction of someone who the modern Disney company has turned into something of a caricature or corporate mascot, of sorts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re preparing for a Disneyland trip, check out our other planning posts, including&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/discount-disneyland-tickets/\" target=\"_blank\">how to save money on Disneyland tickets</a>, our&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/what-to-pack-for-disney/\" target=\"_blank\">Disney packing tips</a>, tips for&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/disneyland-anaheim-hotels-reviews-rankings/\" target=\"_blank\">booking a hotel</a>&nbsp;(off-site&nbsp;<em>or</em>on-site),&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/disneyland-restaurant-reviews/\" target=\"_blank\">where to dine</a>, and a number of other things, check out our&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/disneyland-planning-guide/\">comprehensive Disneyland Vacation Planning Guide</a>!</strong></p>\r\n', '4.jpg', 2, 1, '2018-01-08', '01', '2018-01-08 03:52:21', 0),

Plus, making the most of your time in the parks, changes that are coming in Spring 2018 (and beyond!), and&nbsp;navigating Disneyland during the extensive park-wide refurbishments while Star Wars: Galaxy&rsquo;s Edge is built.&nbsp;<em>(Last updated January 8, 2018.)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We first posted this guide a few years ago when Disney California Adventure had its big reboot, and have updated it multiple times per year since.

If you&rsquo;ve already decided now is the best time, we&rsquo;ll start by providing&nbsp;all the resources you&rsquo;ll need to plan your Disneyland Resort trip, including when to visit, where to stay, what to do, and much more.

It&rsquo;s great for long weekend trips (something we did regularly before moving to California) and extended vacations that incorporate a multitude of sights. Fortunately, Southern California is one of the best places in the world to visit between Los Angeles, San Diego, and the beach cities in between, there&rsquo;s a ton to do in the area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re planning a Southern California vacation beyond Disneyland, you&rsquo;re in luck, as we give away a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.travelcaffeine.com/free-travel-newsletter-signup/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>free eBook,&nbsp;</strong></a><em>101 Things to Do in Southern California&nbsp;</em>over&nbsp;on our non-Disney blog,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.travelcaffeine.com/\" target=\"_blank\">TravelCaffeine</a>. There, we also have a wealth of resources dedicated to visiting the state, including a series of blog posts on California points of interest and our&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.travelcaffeine.com/los-angeles-guide-vacation-tips/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Ultimate Guide to Los Angeles</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Between this blog and that one, you should be totally covered with what you need to know if you&rsquo;re thinking about visiting Disneyland Resort and Southern California this coming year. We can&rsquo;t encourage people enough to give Disneyland a try, especially Disney fans who are biased towards Walt Disney World as their &ldquo;home&rdquo; park. Disneyland is a totally different, much more relaxed experience. It&rsquo;s intimate in both size and feel, and is oozing with history and incredible attractions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want to determine whether&nbsp;you should visit Disneyland in 2018, keep reading&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>SHOULD YOU VISIT&nbsp;DISNEYLAND IN 2018&hellip;OR WAIT?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/talking-donald-duck-minnie-mickey-mouse-nikon-d850-556.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/talking-donald-duck-minnie-mickey-mouse-nikon-d850-556.jpg?resize=620%2C442\" style=\"height:442px; width:620px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even before you dig into those planning posts to which we&rsquo;ve linked above, the threshold question for you might be whether 2018 is a good year to visit, or if you should wait until 2019 when Star Wars: Galaxy&rsquo;s Edge opens?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the upside of visiting Disneyland in 2018: it&rsquo;s going to be something of a calm before the storm. Crowds won&rsquo;t be low, but they will be lower than in 2019, especially as Disneyland starts thinning its herd of Annual Passholders and other tourists delay visits in anticipation of Star Wars: Galaxy&rsquo;s Edge. Without question, lower crowds and prices are&nbsp;<em>the&nbsp;</em>reasons to visit in 2018 as opposed to 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We want to underscore the likelihood that crowds will not be low at Disneyland and DCA in 2018. This is all in relative terms, and they will be&nbsp;<em>lower&nbsp;</em>than in 2019. Once Star Wars: Galaxy&rsquo;s Edge opens, Disneyland is going to be crazy-busy with unprecedented crowd levels. It&rsquo;s also very likely that Disney (and third party hotels in the area) will raise their prices fairly significantly. That&rsquo;s what we witnessed a few years ago when Cars Land opened, and that was not nearly the draw that Star Wars Land will be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of new things for 2018, there&rsquo;s not much on the horizon of significance.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/pixar-pier-disneyland-resort/\" target=\"_blank\">Disneyland has announced that Paint the Night will move to Disney California Adventure</a>, but a debut date has not yet been set.&nbsp;Following that,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/incredicoaster-pixar-pier-summer-2018/\" target=\"_blank\">Pixar Pier and the Incredicoaster will debut in Summer 2018</a>, as an overlay/re-imagining of Paradise Pier. There&rsquo;s also going to be Pixar Fest beginning April 13, 2018 at Disneyland.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we report in the latest update to our&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/disneyland-busy-crowd-times/\" target=\"_blank\">FREE Disneyland Crowd Calendars</a>&nbsp;post, both Halloween and Christmas experienced heavier than normal crowds last year, but thus far in early 2018, crowd levels have been low. Granted, we&rsquo;re only a few days into the year, and the true test of crowds will be what happens once the inevitable SoCal resident ticket deal is released.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Later in the spring, we expect Lunar New Year, Food &amp; Wine Festival, and Pixar Festival to all cause spikes in crowds. And of course, spring break and summer tourist season will result in higher crowd levels, as will pretty much any date when the lower tiers of Annual Passholders aren&rsquo;t blocked out. Early to mid-September 2018 should be a sweet spot for crowds, as should mid-November 2018 if you want to experience either holiday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/fastpass-maxpass-disneyland-summer-963.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/fastpass-maxpass-disneyland-summer-963.jpg?zoom=1.25&amp;resize=620%2C393\" style=\"height:393px; width:620px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In other news, Disneyland has also debuted its (paid)&nbsp;digital FastPass service, known as MaxPass.

Instead of using MaxPass, you can simply pick up a paper FastPass for free. MaxPass saves you some time and walking&ndash;in some scenarios this is a significant advantage, though.</p>\r\n', '5.jpg', 4, 0, '2018-01-08', '01', '2018-01-08 03:53:17', 0);

The information here is updated regularly, so you can be sure that none of the tips are outdated.&nbsp;<em>(Last updated January 7, 2018.</em>)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many first-timers don&rsquo;t realize Walt Disney World is so&nbsp;complicated until they arrive. The commercials make it look like a carefree world where everyone skips holding hands with Mickey Mouse and walking onto rides. That&rsquo;s not the reality. You&nbsp;<em>need&nbsp;</em>to plan. There is a ton to know before you visit Walt Disney World. As complicated as planning might seem, the payoff is worth it. After dozens of trips dating back to the 1980s, we&rsquo;ve learned a lot, and try to distill it into something easy to absorb to make your planning easier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because of how much there is to know when visiting Walt Disney World, we gloss over the basics pretty quickly.

If that&rsquo;s not for you, there are plenty of other planning sites that offer only positive or only negative spins on Disney.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We promise taking the time to learn about Walt Disney World will be worth it, so let&rsquo;s get started&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>WHEN IS A GOOD&nbsp;<em>YEAR&nbsp;</em>TO VISIT?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/creatures-pool-pandora-world-avatar-animal-kingdom-dusk.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/creatures-pool-pandora-world-avatar-animal-kingdom-dusk.jpg?zoom=1.25&amp;resize=620%2C421\" style=\"height:420px; width:620px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, the absolute&nbsp;<em>best&nbsp;</em>year to visit, if you&rsquo;re planning way-way into the future, is 2021. That&rsquo;s Walt Disney World&rsquo;s 50th Anniversary, and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/d23-expo-post-mortem-best-worst-parks-announcements/\" target=\"_blank\">a ton of stuff was announced at the D23 Expo that will debut in time for that</a>. For most people, 2021 is too long to wait, so we&rsquo;ll help you decide whether you should visit in 2018 or 2019 in this section of our Walt Disney World Vacation Planning Guide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ll also briefly cover all of the latest updates around Walt Disney World, in case you&rsquo;ve been before but are wondering what&rsquo;s new and on the horizon. Our most recent visit to Walt Disney World was in Fall 2017 (<a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/hurricane-irma-disney-world-report/\" target=\"_blank\">we actually had to extend our trip due to Hurricane Irma!</a>). During that trip, we stayed at 6 different resorts, dined at more restaurants than I can count, and spent a ton of time checking out the construction around Walt Disney World.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Speaking of which, there is an unprecedented amount of construction at Walt Disney World right now, with the most heavily impacted areas being (in order): Disney&rsquo;s Hollywood Studios (<a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/disneys-hollywood-studios-construction-update-fall-2017/\" target=\"_blank\">read our DHS construction update here</a>), Caribbean Beach Resort (<a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/caribbean-beach-resort-construction-update-fall-2017/\" target=\"_blank\">read our CBR construction update here</a>), Coronado Springs Resort, Disney Springs, and Epcot (<a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/epcot-construction-update-fall-2017/\" target=\"_blank\">read our Epcot construction update here</a>). At present, Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom are largely free of construction walls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Suffice to say, if you&rsquo;re planning a trip between now and 2020, you should plan on encountering some degree of construction. You can definitely minimize how much this impacts your trip, particularly by staying at resort hotels that do not have projects. (Here&rsquo;s our list of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/2018-disney-world-hotel-construction-refurbishment-update/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>2018 Construction &amp; Refurbishments at Walt Disney World Hotels</strong></a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Don&rsquo;t fret too much about the construction&ndash;even with an unprecedented amount, there&rsquo;s still a ton to do at Walt Disney World. Below, we&rsquo;ll go park by park and look at everything new&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/bioluminescence-fisheye-portrait-pandora-world-avatar-disney-world.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/bioluminescence-fisheye-portrait-pandora-world-avatar-disney-world.jpg?resize=314%2C470\" style=\"height:470px; width:314px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pandora &ndash; World of Avatar is the newest land at&nbsp;Disney&rsquo;s Animal Kingdom and the biggest addition in over a decade at Walt Disney World. We absolutely loved this new land. We are not&nbsp;<em>Avatar&nbsp;</em>fans, but this land was very impressive. We could go on and on&hellip;and we did, in our&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/pandora-world-avatar-spoiler-free-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Spoiler-Free Pandora &ndash; World of Avatar Review</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For tips &amp; tricks on beating the crowds,&nbsp;read our&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/guide-pandora-world-avatar-tips/\" target=\"_blank\">Ultimate Guide to Pandora &ndash; World of Avatar</a></strong>.

It is&nbsp;<em>fantastic!&nbsp;</em>You can read our full&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/happily-ever-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Happily Ever After Review</a>&nbsp;for more info.&nbsp;Once Upon a Time is also now showing at&nbsp;Magic Kingdom, which is a nice castle projection show; although it feels a bit redundant and underwhelming after watching Happily Ever After. Hopefully a new night parade arrives in 2018 (we aren&rsquo;t holding our breath).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At Epcot, Soarin&rsquo; Around the World and Frozen Ever After both are still very popular. If you have Frozen fans in your party, read our&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/frozen-ever-review-tips/\" target=\"_blank\">Frozen Ever After Review &amp; Tips</a>&nbsp;post for strategy&ndash;waits are still long for that. The new&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/christmas-food-epcot-holidays-around-world/\" target=\"_blank\">Epcot International Festival of the Holidays</a>&nbsp;is now underway as what has become Epcot&rsquo;s &ldquo;Festival Season.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/construction-disneys-hollywood-studios-disney-world-283.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/construction-disneys-hollywood-studios-disney-world-283.jpg?zoom=1.25&amp;resize=620%2C403\" style=\"height:402px; width:620px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over at Disney&rsquo;s Hollywood Studios, construction for Star Wars Land (officially &ldquo;Star Wars: Galaxy&rsquo;s Edge), Toy Story Land, and Mickey &amp; Minnie&rsquo;s Runaway Railway continues, which means that there are&nbsp;a lot of construction walls and closures. These projects should be awesome<em>&nbsp;</em>once completed, but that won&rsquo;t be&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/toy-story-land-opening-summer-2018/\" target=\"_blank\">2018 in the case of Toy Story Land</a>, and 2019 for Star Wars: Galaxy&rsquo;s Edge and Mickey &amp; Mickey&rsquo;s Runaway Railway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the interim, there is a Star Wars stage show and fireworks show called Star Wars: A Galactic Spectacular, which features a new projection pre-show called Disney Movie Magic.&nbsp;If your time is limited, you might consider skipping Disney&rsquo;s Hollywood Studios altogether. If you want an alternative, we would encourage visitors to take a look at our&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/universal-orlando-trip-planning-guide/\" target=\"_blank\">Universal Orlando Resort Trip Planning Guide</a></strong>, and consider spending a day there to get your studio/thrill ride fix.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then&nbsp;there&rsquo;s Disney Springs. This is the entertainment and shopping district previously known as Downtown Disney. There are still a few ongoing construction projects, with&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/summer-2017-disney-springs-restaurant-news/\" target=\"_blank\">more Disney Springs restaurants opening soon</a>. It&rsquo;s almost done now, and it has made fans of both of us&nbsp;<em>big time</em>&nbsp;with solid additions such as The Boathouse, Jock Lindsay&rsquo;s Hangar Bar, Morimoto Asia, and more. Read our&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/best-restaurants-disney-springs-rankings/\" target=\"_blank\">Best Restaurants in Disney Springs</a></strong>&nbsp;post for more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/amorettes-patisserie-disney-springs-wdw-bakery-293.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/amorettes-patisserie-disney-springs-wdw-bakery-293.jpg?resize=287%2C470\" style=\"height:470px; width:287px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ultimately, in terms of pros versus cons, we see mid-2018 until mid-2019 as a good timeframe to visit if you want to enjoy the &ldquo;calm before the storm&rdquo; before Star Wars: Galaxy&rsquo;s Edge. We recommend waiting until around Memorial Day 2018 to visit, as that&rsquo;s when Toy Story Land is most likely to open.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alternatively, if you&rsquo;re really into Star Wars, you should probably wait until at least Christmas 2019 to visit. While an official opening date has yet to be set for Star Wars: Galaxy&rsquo;s Edge at Walt Disney World, the best case scenario is late 2019. Even then, it&rsquo;s possible the land will be delayed into 2020 or will open in phases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We would not recommend delaying the trip unless you&rsquo;re fine with waiting until around Memorial Day 2020 just to play it safe. If you&rsquo;re already waiting that long, why not just wait another year and a half for Walt Disney World&rsquo;s 50th Anniversary in October 2021?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are other considerations to when you should plan a trip between now and 2021, include price increases, hotel availability, and more. We cover all of these in our&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/best-year-disney-world-vacation/\" target=\"_blank\">Should You Visit Walt Disney World in 2018&hellip;Or Wait Until 2019, 2020?</a>&nbsp;</strong>post.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Okay, now let&rsquo;s tackle the 10 elements of planning a WDW vacation&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>1. WHEN TO VISIT</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/mickeys-boo-to-you-halloween-parade-010.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/mickeys-boo-to-you-halloween-parade-010.jpg?resize=620%2C427\" style=\"height:428px; width:620px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve determined&nbsp;what year you want&nbsp;to head to Walt Disney World, the next, related question is what time of year. The first thing to consider is discounts. We have a post&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/disney-world-discounts/\" target=\"_blank\">Rating the&nbsp;Walt Disney World Discounts</a></strong>, so you can determine which&nbsp;<em>really&nbsp;</em>might be the best options for you depending upon the time of year you&rsquo;re thinking about visiting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/disney-world-free-dining-dates/\" target=\"_blank\">The 2018 Free Disney Dining Plan promotion should be released around in Spring 2018</a>. This is the most popular promotion of the year, and one good reason to take a trip later in the year. Other discounts are typically offered throughout the year, during less busy travel dates. (We will keep&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/newsletter-2/\" target=\"_blank\">our free newsletter</a>&nbsp;subscribers posted on all the latest Free Dining rumors!)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re not able to take advantage of one of those discounts, we have a post that features the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/save-money-disney-world-vacation/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>10 Best Tips to Save Money at Walt Disney World</strong></a>. It covers ideas like&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/disney-gift-card-discount-tips/\" target=\"_blank\">buying discount Disney gift cards to save money</a>!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beyond saving money, crowds are a huge consideration. This has a huge impact on the trip, so choose wisely. Walt Disney World can be crowded, and the time of year you visit can have a dramatic impact on crowd density and attraction wait times. If you have kids in school, you&rsquo;re looking at visiting during school breaks, which are some of the busiest times due to the vast majority of Walt Disney World guests being in the same circumstances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Generally, the week (or so) long breaks are absolutely the worst in terms of crowds. If you&rsquo;re planning a Summer 2018 visit, the first bit of good news is that&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/summer-not-peak-season-disney-world-crowd-trends/\" target=\"_blank\">summer is no longer busy season at Walt Disney World</a>&hellip;at least, not totally. If you&rsquo;re traveling with kids, you&rsquo;ll want to read our&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/disney-world-kids-tips/\" target=\"_blank\">Walt Disney World Trip Planning with Kids</a>&nbsp;guide in addition to this post.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have more thorough tips regarding when to visit on our&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/when-to-visit-disney-world/\">When to Visit Walt Disney World</a>page, which takes into account school schedules, crowds, weather, park hours, and special events. We also have a new&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/best-worst-crowds-disney-world/\" target=\"_blank\">Best and Worst Months to Visit Walt Disney World</a></strong>&nbsp;that ranks every month of the year, and recommends the 3 very best weeks of the year to visit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before solidifying your travel dates, you&rsquo;ll also want to check out our&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/disney-world-refurbishments/\" target=\"_blank\">2018 Walt Disney World Refurbishment Calendar</a>&nbsp;to make sure any must-do attractions won&rsquo;t be closed for renovations during your visit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"walt-disney-world-christmas-pictures-034\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/walt-disney-world-christmas-pictures-034.jpg?resize=381%2C470\" style=\"height:470px; width:381px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walt Disney World is great any day of the year, but we absolutely recommend going during seasonal festivities. We have guides for each big seasonal offering that you can read:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<ul>\r\n		<li><a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/disney-world-christmas-ultimate-guide/\" target=\"_blank\">Ultimate Guide to Christmas at Walt Disney World</a></li>\r\n		<li><a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/mickeys-very-merry-christmas-party-review-tips/\" target=\"_blank\">Mickey&rsquo;s Very Merry Christmas Party</a></li>\r\n		<li><a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/mickeys-not-so-scary-halloween-party-review-tips/\" target=\"_blank\">Mickey&rsquo;s Not So Scary Halloween Party Guide</a></li>\r\n		<li><a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/epcot-flower-garden-festival-photos/\" target=\"_blank\">Flower &amp; Garden Festival Guide &amp; Tips</a></li>\r\n		<li><a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/epcot-food-wine-festival-guide-tips/\" target=\"_blank\">Food &amp; Wine Festival Guide &amp; Tips</a></li>\r\n	</ul>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The two &ldquo;best&rdquo; times of year for seasonal events at Walt Disney World are fall and Christmas. In September and October, you have Food &amp; Wine Festival at Epcot and Mickey&rsquo;s Not So Scary Halloween Party in the Magic Kingdom, plus Halloween decorations. While Food &amp; Wine and the Halloween Party will cost you some money, they are both enjoyable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We love winter and spring events at Epcot: the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/epcot-flower-garden-festival-guide-tips/\" target=\"_blank\">Epcot International Flower &amp; Garden Festival</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/epcot-festival-arts-guide/\" target=\"_blank\">Epcot International Festival of the Arts</a>. The latter will return in January 2018, with Flower &amp; Garden coming back immediately after Festival of the Arts ends, beginning in March 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In late August, Festival Season resumes at Epcot with its popular food &amp; wine event. Read our&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/epcot-food-wine-festival-guide-tips/\" target=\"_blank\">Guide to the Epcot International Food &amp; Wine Festival</a></strong>&nbsp;to prepare for this colossal celebration. Around that same time, Halloween season also kicks off at Magic Kingdom with Mickey&rsquo;s Not So Scary Halloween Party.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During November and December, you have Mickey&rsquo;s Very Merry Christmas Party. Our favorite time to visit is early December, as we&nbsp;<em>love&nbsp;</em>Christmas at Walt Disney World. So much so that we wrote a comprehensive post about the holiday season: read&nbsp;our&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/disney-world-christmas-ultimate-guide/\" target=\"_blank\">Ultimate Guide to Christmas at Walt Disney World</a>&nbsp;</strong>if you need convincing that this is the best time to visit!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is so much going on during the holiday season, and the parks are so beautiful that it just can&rsquo;t be beat. Plus, weather is nicer and if you go at the right time, crowds are relatively light. Since there are seasonal events pretty much every time of year except the very beginning of the calendar year and the middle of summer, pretty much no matter when you visit you&rsquo;re going to be at Walt Disney World during a seasonal event, so it&rsquo;s a good idea to consult those guides before picking your vacation dates to see which event is most appealing to you.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>2. HOW LONG TO STAY</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/empty-ballroom-be-our-guest-restaurant-magic-kingdom-disney-world.jpg\"><img alt=\"empty-ballroom-be-our-guest-restaurant-magic-kingdom-disney-world\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/empty-ballroom-be-our-guest-restaurant-magic-kingdom-disney-world.jpg?resize=620%2C414\" style=\"height:414px; width:620px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>How long you should stay at Walt Disney World depends largely upon the type of trip it is. If you&rsquo;re not much of a Disney fan but are taking your kids on a &ldquo;once in a lifetime&rdquo; rite of passage trip, how long you should stay is dramatically different from how long a Disney fan. For the first time visitor, we recommend a Walt Disney World vacation of at least 6 or 7 days. The exact length will still vary a bit depending upon how much vacation time you have and if you plan on visiting non-Disney theme parks or destinations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re on the fence, the good news is that ParkSavers (an authorized ticket seller) has a limited-time special on a&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://parksavers.com/ref/DTB/walt-disney-world-tickets\" target=\"_blank\">5-day Park Hopper ticket</a></strong>, so this ticket is currently our top recommendation. If that ticket is not right for you, we recommend that you&nbsp;<a href=\"https://parksavers.com/ref/DTB/walt-disney-world-tickets\" target=\"_blank\">compare prices of all multi-day Walt Disney World park tickets</a>, as there are plenty of good deals to be found on other tickets! As an added bonus, readers of this blog can save an extra $2 per ticket with discount code&nbsp;<strong>DISNEYTOURISTBLOG&nbsp;</strong>at check-out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You&rsquo;ll also probably want to build in a day for relaxation, and this is good to plug into the middle of your trip so you don&rsquo;t get worn out by the theme parks. The other consideration for planning trips to Walt Disney World might be how much time to spend doing other things. You might want to do&nbsp;Orlando-area theme parks&nbsp;like Universal Studios Florida&nbsp;(including the Wizarding World of Harry Potter), SeaWorld, Busch Gardens might be places you want to visit. Or maybe you want to visit the beach, or visit local outlet malls&hellip;or go manatee watching&hellip;I have no clue what people enjoy doing outside of Disney.&nbsp;<img alt=\"ðŸ˜‰\" src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/svg/1f609.svg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of all these things, the one place we think you should give serious consideration is Universal Orlando Resort. We have a post titled&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/walt-disney-world-versus-universal-orlando/\" target=\"_blank\">Walt Disney World v. Universal Orlando</a>&nbsp;that covers a lot of the pros and cons of visiting Universal. I am&nbsp;<em>not&nbsp;</em>a Harry Potter fan, but I was absolutely blown away by the Diagon Alley area in Universal Studios Florida and Hogsmeade in Islands of Adventure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s also other stuff at Walt Disney World besides the theme parks to consider when planning how many days you spend there. This &ldquo;other stuff&rdquo;&nbsp;at Walt Disney World consists of Disney Springs, golf, restaurants, water parks, and more. We recommend at least 1-2 partial or full days of this entertainment outside the parks.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>3. PARK TICKETS</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/tombricker.smugmug.com/Disney/Magic-Kingdom/i-fFnqbQb/0/M/cinderella-castle-pavement-M.jpg?zoom=1.25&amp;w=1202\" style=\"height:399px; width:600px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you book a package, you may not have a ton of say over which park tickets you purchase. However, we recommend buying your tickets separately from an&nbsp;<em>authorized&nbsp;</em>third party ticket seller to save money if you can.&nbsp;Read our&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/discount-disney-tickets/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Tips for Buying Discount Walt Disney World Tickets</strong></a>post for everything you need to know about choosing the right tickets and&nbsp;<em>saving money</em>&nbsp;on them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If all you&nbsp;want to know&nbsp;is where&nbsp;to safely buy the cheapest, legitimate Walt Disney World multi-day tickets from an authorized reseller&nbsp;<a href=\"https://parksavers.com/ref/DTB/walt-disney-world-tickets\" target=\"_blank\">click here to buy via ParkSavers</a>, our recommended &amp; Disney-authorized ticket seller. (As mentioned above, their discounted 7-day ticket is what we recommend.)&nbsp;If you&rsquo;re visiting in 2018, you should buy your park tickets as soon as possible to lock-in lower pricing as ticket prices will likely increase in February 2018. Completely unused tickets don&rsquo;t expire, so there&rsquo;s no downside to buying now&ndash;you simply save even more money if Disney increases park ticket prices again between now and your trip.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Currently, Walt Disney World uses&nbsp;Flex Pricing for 1-day tickets with three pricing season tiers: Value, Regular, and Peak. This probably doesn&rsquo;t affect most readers of this guide, but if you&rsquo;re only visiting for 1 day, you should really try to avoid national holidays, school breaks, or weekends, as those are now the most expensive days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The longer the duration of your park tickets, the less they cost per day. Disney&rsquo;s mantra is &ldquo;the longer you play, the less you pay per day.&rdquo; As corny as it sounds, it&rsquo;s true. Single-day Walt Disney World tickets are quite pricey, but multi-day tickets are much cheaper per day. The cost of additional days on a ticket substantially decreases with each day you add after 3 days. In other words, longer trips are not proportionately more expensive than shorter ones. (Too bad the same doesn&rsquo;t apply to hotel rooms!)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is just one of the many tips we cover in&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/discount-disney-tickets/\" target=\"_blank\">our post about&nbsp;</a><a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/discount-disney-tickets/\" target=\"_blank\">saving money on Walt Disney World park tickets</a>. Buying in advance of your trip allows you to book FastPass+ selections up to 60 days before your trip (if you&rsquo;re staying on-site). Whatever you do, don&rsquo;t wait to buy your tickets at the front gates of the parks (or on eBay&hellip;they won&rsquo;t work!), because then you can&rsquo;t book your FastPass+ attractions in advance. You&rsquo;ll understand why this is a huge deal in the sections below&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>4. WHERE TO STAY</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/kidani-village-animal-kingdom-lodge-sunrise-sunburst.jpg\"><img alt=\"kidani-village-animal-kingdom-lodge-sunrise-sunburst\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/kidani-village-animal-kingdom-lodge-sunrise-sunburst.jpg?resize=620%2C422\" style=\"height:422px; width:620px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the very best posts on this blog (we think) is our&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/disney-world-hotel-reviews/\" target=\"_blank\">Walt Disney World Hotel Reviews page</a></strong>. We have stayed at every single on-property Walt Disney World hotel, and that page offers&nbsp;links to each of our hotel reviews. Those reviews feature room photos that we took (among other things), and those are really helpful in deciding which hotel will appeal most to your family. We updated almost every single one of our hotel reviews with new photos last year, so what you see in those is how the room actually looks now, not how it looked a decade ago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re trying to determine where to stay, the threshold question is &ldquo;on-site or off-site?&rdquo; This means, should you stay on Walt Disney World property in a Disney-owned hotel, or stay in a non-Disney owned hotel within driving distance of Walt Disney World.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In general, you get more bang for your buck when staying in an off-site hotel, as there are a lot of non-Disney hotels competing with one another, and they can&rsquo;t charge the premium Disney charges for its name recognition or location. Conversely, non-Disney hotels are typically farther away from the parks, and don&rsquo;t provide the same immersive vacation experience that many people describe as being in the &ldquo;Disney bubble.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another option if you want to save money by staying off-site but want larger accommodations than a standard hotel is Airbnb or a vacation home rental. We&rsquo;ve used Airbnb a ton, and absolutely love it. If you&rsquo;re unfamiliar or uncomfortable with the service, we have a post covering&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/airbnb-tips-tricks/\" target=\"_blank\">Tips for Using Airbnb at Disney</a>&nbsp;</strong>to put you at ease!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Basically, the decision to stay off-site will likely come down to saving money. Comparable (or better) rooms off-site can be significantly cheaper than on-site Walt Disney World hotels. We have an&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/disney-world-hotels-off-site-on-site/\" target=\"_blank\">Off-Site v. On-Site Walt Disney World Hotels</a>&nbsp;article that goes into greater depth about the pros and cons of both options.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re going to stay on-site at Walt Disney World, the three main tiers are Value, Moderate, and Deluxe, which are exactly what their names sound like they are. There&rsquo;s also a Deluxe Villa tier, which is basically Disney-speak for &ldquo;timeshare room.&rdquo; Looking for the best hotel in each tier? Check out the following posts ranking the various Disney hotels:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<ul>\r\n		<li><a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/best-disney-world-value-resorts/\" target=\"_blank\">Value Resort Hotel Rankings</a></li>\r\n		<li><a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/best-moderate-resorts-disney-world/\" target=\"_blank\">Moderate Resort Hotel Rankings</a></li>\r\n		<li><a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/deluxe-hotel-rankings-disney-world/\" target=\"_blank\">Deluxe Resort Hotel Rankings</a></li>\r\n		<li><a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/disney-vacation-club-resort-rankings/\" target=\"_blank\">Deluxe Villa (Disney Vacation Club) Resort Rankings</a></li>\r\n	</ul>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Speaking of the Deluxe Villas/Disney Vacation Club Resorts, if your budget is tight and one of these resorts looks appealing, you might want to read our&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/renting-disney-vacation-club-points/\" target=\"_blank\">Guide to Renting Disney Vacation Club Points</a></strong>, as this is a great way to save money on nicer accommodations than you otherwise might be able to afford.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the first things to know before you go is the&nbsp;MyMagic+ program that includes FastPass+, Magic Bands, Memory Maker, and more. You can read more about each of these components in this system work in our&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/mymagic-plus-faq/\" target=\"_blank\">MyMagic+ FAQ article</a>. FastPass+ is now live in every park, and paper FastPasses are no more. Read our&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/fastpass-plus-disney-world-guide/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Guide to FastPass+ at Walt Disney World</strong></a>&nbsp;to fully understand the new system, and how to best take advantage of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The big thing to know about this system as it pertains to staying on-site or off-site is in terms of FastPass+.&nbsp;Guests staying at a Walt Disney World hotel can make FastPass+ reservations up to 60 days before their trips; those staying off-site can only book FastPass+ reservations up to 30 days in advance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want FastPass+ for popular experiences like Seven Dwarfs Mine Train, Frozen Ever After, Toy Story Mania, or other popular attractions, having the full 60 day window might be the only way to get them. Many of these FastPass+ experiences &ldquo;sell out&rdquo; within hours or days of their 60-day windows opening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a big deal because each of these attractions&nbsp;can have 2+ hour waits depending upon the time of year, so by being able to make these FastPass+ ride reservations with that 60-day window can be the difference between waiting an extra 4-6 hours in line per day, or not. This is also why we highly recommend buying park tickets in advance of your visit. You can still make FastPass+ reservations on the day you arrive at Walt Disney World, but you&rsquo;ll be picking from leftovers that no one else really wants, so to speak.</p>\r\n', '6.jpg', 3, 1, '2018-01-10', '01', '2018-01-10 03:54:41', 0),
(7, 15, 'Free Dining for Summer 2018â€¦Well, Sorta', '<p>A variation of Free Dining is being offered for Summer 2018 at Walt Disney World, including dates May through August. It&rsquo;s not the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/disney-world-free-dining-dates/\" target=\"_blank\">normal Free Disney Dining Plan promotion</a>&nbsp;(which we still expect to be released in the spring&ndash;potentially with some dates overlapping this promo) that has developed a loyal following for fall dates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This discount is available at Walt Disney World Value Resorts and is available for arrivals most nights from May 29 through August 25, 2018, for bookings made through February 11, 2018. The promotion offers guests staying at Value Resorts one Quick Service Meal per night and requires a minimum 3-night stay and purchase of at least a 2-day ticket.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Free Dining fans should&nbsp;<em>not&nbsp;</em>get excited about this deal. Basically, this is &ldquo;Free Dining Light&rdquo;&nbsp;<em>Now with two-thirds fewer calories than normal Free Dining!&nbsp;</em>We think this promotion is Disney&rsquo;s sly way of catching the attention of potential guests with those magic words that everyone loves (free food!), but without actually offering a great deal. With that said, those looking for the&nbsp;<em>full&nbsp;</em>Free Dining discount shouldn&rsquo;t freak out, as if this is a sign of a diminished form of Free Dining to come&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We say that because this promotion is becoming an annual thing (the dates this year are literally only a couple days different from last year) having been introduced two years ago and then dubbed the &ldquo;Summer Meal Plan Offer.&rdquo; Accordingly, this is an updated-for-2018 post from last year offering analysis of whether the Summer Meal Plan offer is worth it&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is sure to be a popular topic among Free Dining enthusiasts and our posts on the&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/disney-dining-plan/\" target=\"_blank\">Disney Dining Plan</a></strong>&nbsp;are some of the most popular on this blog, so we wanted to share the details here and provide our reaction to this new offer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to the aforementioned minimum stay and ticket requirement, Disney&rsquo;s fine print indicates that the offer applies only to Value Resorts, excluding the Little Mermaid rooms at Art of Animation and campsites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/pop-century-hotel.jpg\"><img alt=\"pop-century-hotel\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/pop-century-hotel.jpg?zoom=1.25&amp;resize=600%2C394\" style=\"height:394px; width:600px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note that the free meal for 2018 is&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;the standard Disney Dining Plan definition. Instead, you get a quick service meal consisting of an entree and 1 non-alcoholic beverage. No snack, alcoholic beverage, or refillable mug. If you want more than just the single free meal, you can upgrade to the Quick Service or Standard Disney Dining Plan at a discounted (prorated) price.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Walt Disney World obfuscates the dollar amount of many of their discounts, the &lsquo;value&rsquo; of the Summer Meal Plan Offer is pretty easy to reverse engineer by subtracting the upgrade cost from the full price of the various Disney Dining Plans. In the case of this deal, the dollar value is roughly $19 per adult or $8 per child. (That&rsquo;s the objective value assigned to the meal by Disney&ndash;you can always leverage the Disney Dining Plan to make it worth more&hellip;or use it poorly to make it worth less.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The majority of counter service entrees (thankfully) don&rsquo;t cost enough to make this&nbsp;<em>actually&nbsp;</em>worth $19 per adult. If I were to get a burger and Coke at Cosmic Ray&rsquo;s, the out of pocket cost would be ~$15. If I didn&rsquo;t buy the Coke (I normally just do water), that entree would only be $11.99. There are a&nbsp;<em>lot&nbsp;</em>of counter service entrees in the $10-14 range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For most Walt Disney World Free Dining regulars, it should be apparent that the numbers simply don&rsquo;t add up, and that this isn&rsquo;t as good of a deal as the normal Free Disney Dining Plan promotion. You only get one component of the lowest tier of the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/disney-dining-plan-costs-info-tips/\" target=\"_blank\">Disney Dining Plan</a>, not an entire plan. Normally, with even the Quick Service Disney Dining Plan, each person would receive two meals and one snack per night, plus a refillable mug (per stay).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In other words, this promotion does not even offer&nbsp;<em>half&nbsp;</em>of the value that the normal Free Dining promotion offers. Rather, you&rsquo;re looking about a little over one-third of the value of Free Dining. That&rsquo;s a pretty huge difference.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/walt-disney-world-food-112.jpg\"><img alt=\"walt-disney-world-food-112\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/walt-disney-world-food-112.jpg?resize=620%2C417\" style=\"height:417px; width:620px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, this isn&rsquo;t to say it&rsquo;s impossible to get enough value out of this deal to make it worthwhile. Let&rsquo;s use ourselves as an example:&nbsp;a party of 2 adults booking a room at Pop Century. If you focus on restaurants in our&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/dining-plan-counter-service-best-values/\" target=\"_blank\">Best Values Uses of Counter Service Credits</a>&nbsp;post, you can find order combinations that exceed $20 per person in value. Not a ton of them, but they do exist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Summer rates for Pop Century are around&nbsp;$144 for weekdays and $169 for weekends. Let&rsquo;s convert this to room-only discount terms. For 1 adult staying only weekdays, this would be around a theoretical 14% room discount, for 2 adults&nbsp;a 28% room discount, for 3 adults&nbsp;a 40% discount (due to +$10 for the additional adult), and 4 adults&nbsp;a 49% discount (due to +$10 for the additional adult). In other words, a paltry discount for a single adult, but a pretty solid one for a party of 3 or 4. Of course, all of this math assumes the value of meal ascribed to it by Disney.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s rough math, but should provide the baseline for crunching your own numbers. As you can see, this is either a lukewarm discount or a good one depending upon how many people you have. Even with only 2 people, it&rsquo;s better than the standard room-only discount this time of year&ndash;at least in theory. Unless you are flying solo, the Summer Meal Offer is usually a better theoretical deal than a room-only offer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"magic-kingdom-disney-world-433\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/magic-kingdom-disney-world-433.jpg?resize=292%2C470\" style=\"height:470px; width:292px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With that said, keep in mind that you have to purchase full price tickets from Disney. This negates the value of the offer for Annual Passholders, and also means you can&rsquo;t purchase&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/discount-disney-tickets/\" target=\"_blank\">discounted Walt Disney World tickets from an authorized reseller</a>, which is something to keep in mind when doing the math yourself to determine if &ldquo;Free Dining&rdquo; is a good value for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For others, the problem is as simple as a counter service meal not being worth $19 per adult. This is why we keep calling this a good&nbsp;<em>theoretical&nbsp;</em>deal.&nbsp;When we crunch these numbers, we land on an actual value of $14 for us, meaning our actual discount with this promotion on that same room at Pop Century would be less attractive than a room-only discount. (That&rsquo;s before you factor the money saved on park tickets. In any case, this deal is a non-starter for us since we have Annual Passes.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/DSC_2823-copy.jpg\"><img alt=\"DSC_2823 copy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/DSC_2823-copy.jpg?resize=620%2C415\" style=\"height:414px; width:620px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The question that remains for a lot of people is whether this means Free Dining will still be offered this fall, or if the promo is being reduced and offered earlier this year. Given current trends, I will say with about 95% certainty that Free Dining will still be offered this fall. First, this same promo was offered last year, and Free Dining was released later. Second, the bounceback Free Dining dates have already been released for 2018, and they are exactly what you&rsquo;d expect them to be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is the possibility that the full Free Dining promo will be scaled back this year. Attendance trends were very strong for Walt Disney World last fall, with an uptick in crowds across the board. Given that, it&rsquo;s very well possible there will be fewer dates, more resort restrictions, or less availability for Free Dining in 2018. None of that would surprise us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The thing is, the existence of this discount does not offer any insight into that whatsoever. This discount is nearly identical to what it was last year, and its dates fall mostly over the summer months (arguably, a time when more aggressive discounting could be useful for Disney given crowd trends the last couple of years).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We don&rsquo;t expect Free Dining to disappear&hellip;in 2018. Even though Toy Story Land will likely be a big hit, Star Wars: Galaxy&rsquo;s Edge won&rsquo;t open until the very end of 2019, and there&rsquo;s nothing new to market at Magic Kingdom or Epcot this summer. This year, Disney will still have to incentivize people with discounts to draw them to the resorts during lower occupancy periods. Next year? Well, the jury is still out on that, but if the buzz ahead of Star Wars: Galaxy&rsquo;s Edge is strong, we may see next to nothing in the way of special offers for October through December 2019. But that&rsquo;s a long time from now in a galaxy far, far away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, our take is that this is an okay offer, so long as you have at least 2 adults in the room and can&rsquo;t find a room-only discount that works for you. Room rates for the Value Resorts have creeped up over the last several years and are now in &lsquo;absurd&rsquo; territory for what you&rsquo;re getting, and this bumps them down into a more realistic realm. It&rsquo;s not the best promotion ever, but it might be the best you&rsquo;re going to get for this time of year. People often travel during the summer months for lack of better options; Disney does not typically offer aggressive discounts for the summer, presumably because those aren&rsquo;t necessary to &lsquo;lure&rsquo; guests to the parks that time of year.</p>\r\n', '7.jpg', 1, 1, '2018-01-10', '01', '2018-01-10 03:55:51', 0);

(8, 15, '2018 Discount Disneyland Ticket Tips', '<p>We cover&nbsp;tips &amp; tricks to save money on Disneyland tickets, the best tickets to buy, the pros and cons of getting Park Hoppers, and other discount Disneyland ticket info. While you can buy 2018 Disneyland tickets at AAA &amp; Costco, the cheaper route is online via authorized ticket sellers.&nbsp;<em>(Last updated January 8, 2018</em>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If all you&rsquo;re looking for is the&nbsp;<strong>best, cheapest, and safest places to buy Disneyland tickets,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.getawaytoday.com/tickets/disneylandresortarea?referrerid=7473\" target=\"_blank\">our top recommendation is Get Away Today</a></strong><strong>.&nbsp;</strong>Right now, their best deal is on a 5-day Park Hopper ticket for the price of a 4-day ticket (which also includes $400 worth of coupons for Southern California&ndash;many of them are useless, but you&rsquo;ll probably find a bit of value in some of them). For many people, a 5-day ticket is too much, so fortunately, there are plenty of tickets for shorter durations that are also discounted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.getawaytoday.com/?referrerid=7473\" target=\"_blank\">Get Away Today currently has several hotel/ticket bundle discounts</a>, including the 4th night free of your hotel stay at certain hotels,&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;5th day free on your park tickets. This deal can also be stacked with hotel bundles to save even more. (And you&rsquo;re also locking in ticket prices now before the inevitable February 2018 price increase.) Even if you don&rsquo;t need a hotel, we have info on where to find Disneyland ticket deals&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are frugal so we&rsquo;ve analyzed the different options before buying Disneyland tickets, and thought we&rsquo;d share some of what we&rsquo;ve learned beyond that in this post. Even if you&rsquo;re cheap like us, one thing we&nbsp;<em>always&nbsp;</em>suggest is getting the Park Hopper option. With the 2 parks less than 2 minutes apart by foot, this is really important. In terms of where to buy, authorized sellers are the best option.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Purchasing online in advance is the best idea, but there are other options if you&rsquo;d rather buy in person, including Disneyland Good Neighbor Hotels in Anaheim, AAA, Safeway, and Costco stores in Southern California. Note that these stores don&rsquo;t always carry Disneyland tickets, and even when they do, sometimes the discounts are quite minimal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you live in Southern California (and have proof of residence), discounted tickets are currently available for now through May 24, 2018. These tickets are offered every spring to SoCal residents during a time when attendance is historically light. For 2018, the prices have increased for these tickets by about $50 across the board, with the 3-day ticket offer starting at $199 per ticket&nbsp;for Southern California residents within ZIP codes 90000-93599. Again, proof or residence is required to purchase these tickets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you aren&rsquo;t a SoCal resident, but are already on vacation in California, sometimes AAA, Safeway, and Costco have small discounts of a couple dollars per ticket. It&rsquo;s less than Get Away Today or ParkSavers, but better than nothing. In the past, Costco stores on the West Coast offered&nbsp;a gift card with purchase, but this has not happened for 2 years<em>.&nbsp;</em>Whatever you do, do&nbsp;<em>not&nbsp;</em>just stop at a random roadside store in Anaheim or Los Angeles and buy tickets. Those are most likely scams (more on that below).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With Disneyland attendance at an all-time high, it&rsquo;s unlikely Disneyland will have an incentive anytime soon to lure West Coasters with these deals at Safeway or Costco.&nbsp;Note that AAA and Disney ended their partnership last year, so the savings there are no longer as good. More importantly, they no longer offer free parking, which was a really big deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/disneyland-discount-park-ticket-tips-2.jpg\"><img alt=\"disneyland-discount-park-ticket-tips\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/disneyland-discount-park-ticket-tips-2.jpg?resize=484%2C470\" style=\"height:470px; width:484px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now that you now that, let&rsquo;s cover where you should and shouldn&rsquo;t purchase tickets. Where you&nbsp;<em>shouldn&rsquo;t&nbsp;</em>buy tickets is as important as where you should buy them. Disneyland authorizes some&nbsp;third parties to sell its tickets at slight discounts, and there is a&nbsp;<strong>huge&nbsp;</strong>black market for bootleg and partially-used &ldquo;rental&rdquo; tickets. You might be familiar with this because&nbsp;<a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2013/jan/08/business/la-fi-mo-disneyland-ticket-abuse-20130108\" target=\"_blank\">Disneyland&rsquo;s crackdown on these tickets has garnered national media attention</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whatever you do, do not buy Disneyland tickets on eBay, Craigslist, or on the side of the road near Disneyland Resort. Ticket &ldquo;rental&rdquo; is a scam, and you will be throwing your money away. Disney Cast Members will not have any sympathy if you&rsquo;re caught with &ldquo;rental&rdquo; tickets; you will have to purchase new tickets at the gate, at full price. Not a fun way to start a vacation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Much like Walt Disney World, Disneyland offers tickets with a &ldquo;hopper&rdquo; option (the ability to visit both parks in the same day) and one-day, one-park tickets that don&rsquo;t allow hopping. Unsurprisingly, non-hopper tickets are cheaper. One day non-hopper tickets now start at&nbsp;$97, whereas hopper tickets are over $150, before tax. Multi-day tickets cost more, but offer better value as the per-day cost decreases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.getawaytoday.com/tickets/disneylandresortarea?referrerid=7473\" target=\"_blank\">The best,&nbsp;<strong>safe</strong>&nbsp;place to purchase discounted multi-day tickets is Get Away Today</a>. These tickets are the same as what you&rsquo;d purchase directly from Disneyland, and are FastPass-enabled, and also can be used to purchase the new digital MaxPass option (different topic, but&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/disneyland-fastpass-guide-tips/\" target=\"_blank\">we recommend MaxPass if you&rsquo;re going during the busy holiday season</a>&nbsp;around Thanksgiving or Christmas this year!)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another site to consider for discount Disneyland tickets is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://parksavers.com/ref/DTB/disneyland-tickets\" target=\"_blank\">ParkSavers</a>. If you already know how many days you&rsquo;re going, that&rsquo;s really all you need to know before buying. If you aren&rsquo;t sure how many days to go, or which ticket options to buy, keep reading&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, remember that this guide is for Disneyland Resort, encompassing Disneyland (park) and Disney California Adventure. If you&rsquo;re visiting Walt Disney World in Florida, check out our&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/discount-disney-tickets/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Tips for Saving Money on Walt Disney World Tickets</strong></a>&nbsp;post. With that said, here are my thoughts on which Disneyland tickets you should purchase&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>1-DAY VISIT</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Disneyland\'s summer fireworks presentation, \" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/tombricker.smugmug.com/Disney/Disneyland/i-S7vdDZC/0/M/0818101156-M.jpg?zoom=1.25&amp;w=1202\" style=\"height:399px; width:600px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>No one should visit Disneyland for only one day. Even if you&rsquo;re only wanting to visit Disneyland park and aren&rsquo;t a big Disneyland fan. That said, if you really only want to do a single day so that you can see everything else that Southern California has to offer, purchase a 1-day non-hopper pass and visit only Disneyland park.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Try to avoid national holidays, school breaks, and weekends, as those are the most expensive times of year for 1-day Flex tickets. If you go right at park opening (as you should to avoid crowds) and stay until park closing, that&rsquo;s a lot of hours&rsquo; worth of entertainment, and pretty good bang for your buck.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you only visit for one day without a park hopper, you won&rsquo;t be able to visit the awesome Cars Land in Disney California Adventure, but it&rsquo;s impossible to do everything in both parks in one day. If you are really ambitious and want to see Cars Land, too, buy a hopper ticket, start at Disney California Adventure (doing Radiator Springs Racers first) and then hop over to Disneyland once you experience a few things in Disney California Adventure.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>2-DAY VISITS</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Tips for Buying Discounted Disneyland Tickets\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/disneyland-tickets-fastpasses-2.jpg?zoom=1.25&amp;resize=633%2C436\" style=\"height:436px; width:633px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A lot of people reading this are probably planning a stop at Disneyland as part of a longer vacation in Southern California. These people are not necessarily Disney fans, but are considering some time in the parks because Disneyland is an &ldquo;American institution.&rdquo; If this describes you, our recommendation is the 2-Day Park Hopper Ticket. This allows you a day for each park (Disneyland and Disney California Adventure), and the ability to bounce back and forth between the two parks during your visit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As you&rsquo;ll read in our Park Hopper section below, we&nbsp;<em>always&nbsp;</em>recommend the park hopper option if your budget allows. They are slightly more expensive, but it is money very well spent. This is because it&rsquo;s so easy to walk back and forth between the parks, and staggered opening and closing hours make it really worthwhile (much moreso than at Walt Disney World, where park hopping can be a pain).</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>3-DAY OR MORE&nbsp;VISITS</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s where you can start finding good discounts on&nbsp;tickets. Every day you add after three amounts to a smaller increase in cost, meaning the cost per day of Disneyland and Disney California Adventure tickets is significantly lower. Same goes for park hopper versus non-hopper tickets. For this reason, I think that if you are debating between three and four days at Disneyland, and park hopper or non-hopper, always err on the side of &ldquo;too much.&rdquo; Go for an extra day&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;get the hopper. Despite Disneyland only being two parks, there is a LOT to do in those two parks (especially Disneyland).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for how many days, if Disneyland and Disney California Adventure are the focus of your Southern California vacation,&nbsp;<strong>we recommend the average guest spend 3-5 days at Disneyland Resort</strong>. Walt Disney World regulars visiting Disneyland for the first time and other serious Disney fans could easily spend 5 days (or more) at Disneyland Resort and not run out of things to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to Disney fans being able to spend 5 days in the parks, the 5-day Park Hopper Ticket is a great value if you want more bang for your buck. If you&rsquo;re big on Disney or just want the best value for your money, this ticket is definitely the way to go. Of course, not everyone is going to want to spend 5 days at Disneyland (there&rsquo;s a ton to do in Southern California!), so it&rsquo;s not for everyone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If Disneyland is the focus of your vacation, consider booking one of the nearby hotels within (walking distance of the parks) and bundling that with tickets for more savings.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/disneyland-anaheim-hotels-reviews-rankings/\" target=\"_blank\">We have a post ranking the hotels near Disneyland to help you choose which might be best for you</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>WHY GET THE PARK HOPPER OPTION?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/mermaid-lagoon-monorail-subs-sunset-bricker-disneyland.jpg\"><img alt=\"mermaid-lagoon-monorail-subs-sunset-bricker-disneyland\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/mermaid-lagoon-monorail-subs-sunset-bricker-disneyland.jpg?resize=620%2C409\" style=\"height:409px; width:620px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s why you should get the hopper: Disneyland and Disney California Adventure are literally less than a football field apart. It&rsquo;s easy to jump from one to the other, and we do on every single visit. This allows you to hit Radiator Springs Racers first thing every morning of our trip, and then either continue the day at Disney California Adventure, or head over to Disneyland.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you do continue the day at Disney California Adventure, having the hopper allows you to go to Disneyland late at night for the fireworks, or to head over to Disneyland to end the day, because it&rsquo;s usually open later. There&rsquo;s a lot of nighttime entertainment to see, and it&rsquo;s tough to see it all in one night.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You&nbsp;can also bounce back and forth between the parks collecting FastPasses, making for more efficient touring&ndash;this is incredibly helpful during the busiest times of the year, like summer, spring break, and Christmas. You don&rsquo;t waste time going between the Disneyland Resort parks like you do at Walt Disney World, so it&rsquo;s really good from a strategic and &lsquo;most bang for your buck&rsquo; perspective, the Park Hopper is it!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regardless of which ticket you purchase, if you&rsquo;re buying a 3-5 day ticket, we recommend buying your Disneyland tickets in advance from authorized ticket brokers to save money&nbsp;and time over purchasing the tickets at the gates when you arrive at Disneyland Resort. Once again, and we cannot reiterate this enough, but don&rsquo;t buy tickets at roadside stands near Disneyland&ndash;those are scams!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>CITYPASS FOR SOCAL THEME PARKS</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are wanting to visit other theme parks as part of your Southern California vacation, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://parksavers.com/product/adult-so-california-citypass/ref/DTB?campaign=socalcitypass\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>SoCal CityPass</strong></a>&nbsp;might appeal to you. This pass includes a 3-day Park Hopper ticket for Disneyland and Disney California Adventure, plus 1-day tickets to both SeaWorld and LEGOLAND California.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Price-wise, this is a great discount, but that&rsquo;s only the case if you want to visit all of these parks. Keep in mind that both SeaWorld and LEGOLAND are located near San Diego, which is over 2-hours away from Disneyland Resort by car. And that assumes light to moderate traffic, which is pretty rare in California!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, if you are thinking of other theme parks in California, the two we recommend are Knott&rsquo;s Berry Farm and Universal Studios Hollywood, neither of which are available via CityPass. Both of these parks are located significantly closer to Disneyland (Knott&rsquo;s is less than 15 minutes away, and Universal Studios Hollywood is under an hour away&ndash;but the latter is very traffic-dependent since it requires driving through Los Angeles). If you are thinking about doing Disneyland and Universal Studios Hollywood,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.getawaytoday.com/tickets/disneylandresortarea?referrerid=7473\" target=\"_blank\">Get Away Today has good prices on ticket bundles</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With all of this in mind, we are not big advocates of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://parksavers.com/product/adult-so-california-citypass/ref/DTB?campaign=socalcitypass\" target=\"_blank\">Southern California CityPass</a>. It can be a great deal for some people, but unless you have your mind set on visiting LEGOLAND and SeaWorld in addition to Disneyland,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/best-things-southern-california/\" target=\"_blank\">we think there are better things to do in Southern California outside of Disneyland</a>&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>DISNEYLAND ANNUAL PASSES?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Tips for Saving Money on Disneyland Tickets by Buying from Authorized Third Parties (AAA, Costco, etc.)\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/DSC_1000-as-Smart-Object-1-copy.jpg?resize=640%2C443\" style=\"height:438px; width:633px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you don&rsquo;t live in Southern California and you&rsquo;re going to be at Disneyland for more than 10-13&nbsp;days in a given 365 day period, there&rsquo;s a decent chance one of the Annual Passes&nbsp;is best&nbsp;for you. If you live in SoCal, the&nbsp;Southern California Select Annual Pass and Souther California Annual Pass (which is once again being sold after being discontinued for 2 years) are options.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These are particularly attraction if you have a flexible schedule and will be in the parks more than 5 days per year. Note that you must have a California Driver&rsquo;s License to purchase the SoCal Annual Pass. Also, parking is not included in either of these Annual Passes, and that&rsquo;s a cost that can add up quickly.&nbsp;Before buying any Annual Pass, look at the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://disneyland.disney.go.com/passes/deluxe/blockout-dates/\" target=\"_blank\">blockout calendar</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Deluxe&nbsp;Annual Pass is blocked out for about 50 days per year (usually days predicted to be the busiest&ndash;like weekends and holidays), whereas the Southern California Select Annual Pass is blocked out 195 days per year&ndash;all summer, weekends, and any day that is predicted to be remotely busy. Basically, if you can&rsquo;t attend on a weekday, this pass is not for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re a regular Walt Disney World Guest or an Annual Passholder at Walt Disney World, determine whether the $1,400+ Premier Annual Pass good at both Walt Disney World and Disneyland is right for you by doing the math. This is the top tier of both Annual Passes and is sort of like the &lsquo;status symbol&rsquo; equivalent of an AMEX Centurion Card&hellip;but for Disney nerds. For this Annual Pass, there is no Disney Vacation Club discount and no renewal discount.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While it&rsquo;s valid for approximately 130 days more than the SoCal Select Annual Pass (for exactly the same price), it never includes admission to Disneyland. We love DCA, but Disneyland is the far superior park, so that&rsquo;s a deal-breaker. The numerous blockout dates and lack of access to Disneyland make this a really poor offer, in our opinion. We do not recommend this AP to&nbsp;<em>anyone</em>&nbsp;as a result.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"save-money-disneyland-tickets-tips\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/save-money-disneyland-tickets-tips.jpg?resize=202%2C470\" style=\"height:470px; width:202px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Okay, so that&rsquo;s all a lot to digest.

(9, 17, 'Disney Parks Tickets Tips & Tricks', '<p>Wonder what Disney park tickets to buy to save money? Where to purchase them? Time-saving add-ons? We answer these questions &amp; cover tips for Walt Disney World, Disneyland, Disneyland Paris, Tokyo Disneyland, and Hong Kong Disneyland park tickets in this post, along with links to helpful resources concerning Disney park tickets, plus a coupon code and info about deals to save you even more money on park tickets! (<em>Last updated January 10, 2018.</em>)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tickets are often one of&ndash;if not the&ndash;most expensive aspects of any Disney vacation, so knowing you&rsquo;ve purchased the right tickets for your needs and that you&rsquo;ve done everything you can to save money is crucial. As ticket prices increase regularly<em>,</em>&nbsp;now more than ever it&rsquo;s important to find the best, most accurate, and&nbsp;<em>legitimate</em>&nbsp;information about saving money on Disney tickets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When it comes to Walt Disney World and Disneyland tickets, the regular price increases should be stressed. For the last several years, this has occurred in mid-February, meaning the next increase is likely to occur in February 2018. With only a month until that happens, it&rsquo;s a good idea to buy now if you&rsquo;re planning a trip at any point in 2018. Purchasing tickets now locks in the current pricing, even if you use the tickets after the increase. On top of that, we cover other ways to score legitimate discounts on Disney Parks tickets for 2018&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We cannot stress the &ldquo;legitimate&rdquo; part of the above enough. Since literally the opening day of Disneyland when&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2010/09/disneyland/\" target=\"_blank\">thousands of people overcrowded the park with counterfeit tickets</a>, there have been problems with fake and unauthorized tickets in the parks. From roadside stands to eBay to Craigslist to shady websites and beyond, there are many Disney ticket scams to which budget-conscious guests fall prey. Worse yet, if you purchase invalid tickets from a scam&ndash;even if you do so innocently&ndash;Disney won&rsquo;t honor the tickets, nor will they have any sympathy for your mistake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is why we cannot stress this enough: if a ticket deal seems too good to be true, it probably is. While it is possible to save money on Disney tickets, most savings are of around $5 to $30 per ticket. You will&nbsp;<em>never&nbsp;</em>find legitimate, half-price tickets.&nbsp;Our Disney ticket tips &amp; tricks cover only the best, legitimate ways to save money on Disney tickets, and&nbsp;<em>authorized</em>&nbsp;sellers from which to buy those tickets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s start with Walt Disney World tickets&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>WALT DISNEY WORLD</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Disney resort with the most park ticket options is Walt Disney World. This is both good and bad. It&rsquo;s good because there are myriad choices that enable you to buy&nbsp;<em>exactly</em>&nbsp;what you need and nothing more or less. It&rsquo;s bad because understanding all of the different combinations can be difficult for a first-time Walt Disney World guest. Disney representatives often only make matters worse, as they&nbsp;upsell or subtly &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; (nothing with Disney is ever high-pressure) guests into buying the more expensive tickets, always encouraging guests add the Park Hopper option, among other things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To underscore just how much you can save by knowing which type of tickets to buy and from which authorized discount ticket brokers to buy them,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.getawaytoday.com/tickets/orlandotickets?referrerid=7473\" target=\"_blank\">Get Away Today currently has select tickets with an extra day FREE!</a>&nbsp;This will save you a lot of money over buying park tickets directly from Disney.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Simply knowing about the different options so you don&rsquo;t purchase unnecessary add-ons and buying from the discount sellers with the best price on particular tickets can save you a lot of money, and significantly cut down on the cost of your park tickets. It&rsquo;s pretty easy to do, especially since many guests (especially those families with small children) don&rsquo;t truly need Park Hopper or other add-ons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In our&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/discount-disney-tickets/\" target=\"_blank\">Tips for Saving Money on Walt Disney World Tickets</a></strong>&nbsp;post, we discuss which add-ons you should and should not get, how many days you might want tickets, and also compare prices (nothing beats that 7-day ticket, though).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;ll also be heading to Universal Orlando Resort while you&rsquo;re in Florida,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tickets.parksavers.com/attraction/single/9642/996\">ParkSavers has an excellent sale on Universal tickets</a>! You get 3 days for the price of 2, which means you can visit Universal Studios Florida, Islands of Adventure, and Volcano Bay. If you only want a 2-day ticket, they have a deal offering adult tickets at child pricing.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>DISNEYLAND</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"disney-annual-passes copy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/disney-annual-passes-copy.jpg?resize=236%2C470\" style=\"height:470px; width:236px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Disneyland tickets are a bit more straight-forward, since there aren&rsquo;t water parks or other entertainment options at Disneyland Resort that can be added onto tickets. Here, it&rsquo;s basically a question of whether or not to get the Park Hopper&nbsp;option, and how many days to stay in the first place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AAA, Safeway, Costco, and a handful of other SoCal retailers have small discounts of a couple dollars per ticket in store from time to time, but those savings are usually $1-4 per ticket. Additionally, there is currently a Southern California resident specials on tickets that runs through May 21, 2018. Right now, your best option is purchasing online via authorized discounted sellers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The best deals for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.getawaytoday.com/tickets/disneylandresortarea?referrerid=7473\">buying Disneyland tickets safely and securely via Get Away Today</a>, which is an authorized sellers of Disneyland tickets with the best prices and customer service that we&rsquo;ve found. If you already know how many days worth of tickets you need and are looking for the best price, that&rsquo;s all you need to know.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No matter where you purchase your tickets, you can add-on the new MaxPass digital FastPass service. As we share in our&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/disneyland-fastpass-guide-tips/\" target=\"_blank\">Disneyland FastPass &amp; MaxPass Tips</a>&nbsp;post, this can be a time-saving purchase, especially during more crowded days. While we don&rsquo;t like paying for FastPass in principle, this can enable you to do 3-4 additional headliner attractions per day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you need more assistance with determining how many days to buy tickets, if you should&nbsp;get the Park Hopper option, and whether an Annual Pass might actually make sense, check out our&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/discount-disneyland-tickets/\" target=\"_blank\">Tips for Saving Money on Disneyland Tickets</a>&nbsp;</strong>post.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>DISNEYLAND PARIS</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/disneyland-paris-annual-pass-copy.jpg\"><img alt=\"disneyland-paris-annual-pass copy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/disneyland-paris-annual-pass-copy.jpg?resize=620%2C414\" style=\"height:414px; width:620px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both Disneyland Paris and Hong Kong Disneyland are unique in that if you plan to spend as few as 3 days in either, you might be better off just buying an Annual Pass. Disneyland Paris just released a new range of Annual Passes last year, with the new tiers being the Discovery, Magic Flex, Magic Plus, and Infinity Annual Passes. These APs range in price from &euro;139 to &euro;399, with 150 days of access on the low end up to 365 days of access on the Infinity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Annual Passes are also great for discounts on food, merchandise, hotels, and more, and these discounts can lower the break even point. For my last 5&nbsp;day trip to Disneyland Paris, it was worth getting the Annual Pass despite not spending 6&nbsp;days in the parks (blockout dates precluded me from doing the lower tiers) due to the discounts&hellip;and the vague hope that I&rsquo;d be back to France within the year.&nbsp;<img alt=\"ðŸ˜‰\" src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/svg/1f609.svg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As far as regular park tickets go, Disneyland Paris has adopted surge pricing, meaning that single day ticket prices vary based upon anticipated attendance. This makes things a bit more complex, since there are three tiers of normal single day tickets now: Mini, Magic, and Super Magic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note that only the single day tickets are subject to the tiered pricing. If you purchase a multi-day ticket, the tiers are irrelevant. However, even if you are going for multiple days, you should look at the tiered pricing calendar, as 2 Mini tickets (if you&rsquo;re going during a slow season) is actually a cheaper option than one 2-day ticket. Zut alores, tr&egrave;s compliqu&eacute;!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For multi-day tickets, there are also some money-saving options available, particularly for Europeans. Americans might have a more difficult time scoring deals, but we cover all the ways to save in our&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/disneyland-paris-ticket-tips-info/\" target=\"_blank\">Disneyland Paris Park Ticket Tips &amp; Info</a>&nbsp;</strong>post.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>TOKYO DISNEY RESORT</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/tokyo-disneyland-tickets-copy.jpg\"><img alt=\"tokyo-disneyland-tickets copy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/tokyo-disneyland-tickets-copy.jpg?resize=620%2C399\" style=\"height:399px; width:620px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your options are pretty limited when it comes to tickets for Tokyo Disneyland and DisneySea, but the good news is that park tickets there are significantly cheaper than for the US Disney Parks. The Japanese parks most definitely are locals&rsquo; parks, so the pricing strategy there is to charge a premium for Annual Passes (which are significantly more expensive than Annual Passes for the US Disney Parks) and less for one to four day tickets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not only are the single and multi-day ticket prices lower, but for Americans, the dollar-to-yen exchange rate is excellent right now, making park tickets for us a relative steal (of course, you still have to pay for airfare to get there in the first place!). If you&rsquo;re visiting during a busy time or on a weekend,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.klook.com/activity/695-tokyo-disney-resort-2-day-pass-tokyo/?aid=1459\" target=\"_blank\">we recommend purchasing tickets in advance from Klook</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of park hopping, save for special tickets available to Disney hotel guests (that we do not recommend purchasing), it&rsquo;s not an add-on option. If you buy a ticket of 2 days or less, you cannot park hop. If you buy over 2 days, you automatically get hopping on days 3 and 4. We&rsquo;ve found this to be ideal, as you don&rsquo;t need to park hop before then. We really only hop on our last day, typically.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Read our&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/discount-tickets-tokyo-disneyland/\" target=\"_blank\">Money-Saving Tips for Tokyo Disneyland Park Tickets</a>&nbsp;</strong>post for our full recommendations on buying the best tickets&ndash;and at the best prices&ndash;for Tokyo Disneyland and Tokyo DisneySea!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>HONG KONG DISNEYLAND</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Hong Kong Disneyland has by far the easiest ticket system. There are 1-day and 2-day park tickets (no Park Hopper since there&rsquo;s only one park), and three tiers of Annual Passes: Silver (valid for 250&nbsp;days per year), Gold (valid for 340&nbsp;days per year), and Platinum (valid for&nbsp;365&nbsp;days per year). Each of these passes also offers discounts on food, merchandise, and hotels. The break even point on the Silver is 3 days, with the other passes&nbsp;having varying break even points of ~6-10 days based upon whether you&rsquo;d buy 1 or 2 day tickets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>About the only way to save on single day Hong Kong Disneyland tickets of which I&rsquo;m aware is to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.klook.com/activity/39-hong-kong-disneyland-hong-kong/?aid=1459\" target=\"_blank\">buy from Klook, which will save you about $8 per ticket</a>, and will allow you to instantly print your ticket.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>SHANGHAI DISNEYLAND</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/shanghai-disneyland-grand-opening-fastpass-007.jpg\"><img alt=\"shanghai-disneyland-grand-opening-fastpass-007\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/shanghai-disneyland-grand-opening-fastpass-007.jpg?resize=620%2C438\" style=\"height:438px; width:620px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The good news is that park tickets for Shanghai&nbsp;Disneyland are inexpensive as compared to the US parks, especially during their low seasons (they also have surge pricing); you can find a current listing of prices&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.shanghaidisneyresort.com/en/tickets/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bad news is that only 1-2 day tickets are offered and, to our knowledge, discount tickets are not yet widely available for foreign visitors. We&rsquo;ve found a couple of sites that promise ~$3 savings per ticket, but they look questionable, and we do not feel it is worth taking a gamble for such insignificant savings. At least, until we can find a more reputable source.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You&rsquo;ll have a few options once you purchase, including a paper voucher or digital ticket. We recommend&nbsp;the digital route, taking a screenshot of the ticket (for safety in case the internet is down) as well. Make sure to bring your passport in case the Cast Member requests to check your ID (you should&nbsp;<em>always&nbsp;</em>have your passport on your person when traveling internationally).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shanghai Disneyland also offers &ldquo;Disney Premier Access&rdquo; which is a paid, digital FastPass service for its most popular attractions. If you only have 1-day in Shanghai Disneyland and don&rsquo;t arrive at rope drop, this can be a good, time-saving purchase. If you do rope drop, stay late, or have multiple days in the park, we view this as unnecessary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Planning a visit to one of the Disney theme parks?

If you have a goal, waiting for the changing of a calendar seems silly, and the common knowledge that most resolutions fail provides justification when giving up on that goal since &ldquo;everyone else did too.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nevertheless, people seem to like New Year&rsquo;s Resolutions. Since we recently reviewed what we had done last year in order to come up with some goals for our 2018 Walt Disney World trips, I figured I might as well flesh that list out with a few more ideas and make a top 10 list. In hindsight, I have to admit that it was a good exercise; two of my favorite ideas in the top 5 were the result of us discussing ideas for this post. (<em>So perhaps New Year&rsquo;s Resolutions aren&rsquo;t so bad after all!)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For this list of Walt Disney World New Year&rsquo;s Resolutions, we tried to come up with things that are actual long-term goals that will require some degree of discipline to achieve. Even though a couple entries are things we know we&rsquo;ll accomplish simply by virtue of the trip we&rsquo;ve already booked, we didn&rsquo;t want this to devolve into a checklist of one-and-done things. After all, these are resolutions, not our Disney bucket list. With that said, here are our Walt Disney World goals for 2018&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>10. More Off-Site Hotel Stays</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Last year we didn&rsquo;t do a single off-site hotel stay at Walt Disney World. Between the year before that was filled with many, and regular off-site hotel stays at Disneyland, we were a bit burned out and just wanted to convenience of Disney&rsquo;s hotels. Plus, there were a lot of room renovations and other on-site hotel action that we needed to cover.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While we&rsquo;re resolving to do this for the sake of more comprehensive coverage on the blog, I suspect we&rsquo;ll also be pushed into doing this by virtue of prices. Hotel discounts really dried up towards the end of last year, and those discounts that were available had really limited inventory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For us, Walt Disney World hotels aren&rsquo;t even close to worth their rack rates. If we can&rsquo;t score at least a 20% discount (usually more), we&rsquo;ll look off-site. With our supply of DVC points depleted this year, I suspect that&rsquo;ll mean more off-site nights during the increasingly popular Halloween and Christmas seasons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/amorettes-patisserie-disney-springs-wdw-bakery-292.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/amorettes-patisserie-disney-springs-wdw-bakery-292.jpg?zoom=1.25&amp;resize=620%2C403\" style=\"height:402px; width:620px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>9.&nbsp;More Disney Springs</strong>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp; The easiest types of resolutions are the ones that you know will occur regardless, thanks to coincidence or prior planning. (Hence my &ldquo;eat more ice cream&rdquo; resolution right after buying a couple tubs of it.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even though our amount of time spent at Disney Springs has increased each of the last several years, we still want to spend more time there this year. Given that we have hotel stays booked at several Disney Springs Resort Area Hotels that are within walking distance of Disney Springs itself, it&rsquo;s pretty much a foregone conclusion that we&rsquo;ll accomplish this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Irrespective of that, this would be a resolution. A ton of new restaurants have opened at Disney Springs that we have to try for the sake of &ldquo;research,&rdquo; and we&rsquo;d love to revisit some of our new-ish favorites like the Boathouse and Morimoto Asia. It also doesn&rsquo;t hurt that many of these third party restaurants offer far superior value for money than in-park options.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>8. More Boat Rides</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; The boats at Walt Disney World are awesome, and few attractions can compare to the leisurely ride from Fort Wilderness to Magic Kingdom at night while the Electrical Water Pageant is running. (Speaking of which, watching the Electrical Water Pageant more this year is another goal.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over in the Crescent Lake area, we don&rsquo;t use the Friendship Boats nearly enough. We usually walk, reasoning that it&rsquo;ll be faster or good exercise. We need to slow down and enjoy the journey more, and this is one such way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/pecos-bill-new-menu-disney-world-magic-kingdom-006.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/pecos-bill-new-menu-disney-world-magic-kingdom-006.jpg?resize=620%2C420\" style=\"height:420px; width:620px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>7. Less Counter Service</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Due to menu simplification and price increases, in-park counter service restaurants are becoming less attractive to us. At Magic Kingdom in particular, mealtime is met with ambivalence. We aren&rsquo;t really wild about many of the counter service restaurants there, and the ones we do enjoy can be a hassle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This results in us debating whether to leave the park and eat at one of the resorts, an idea we usually nix due to transit time and security hassles. We then look to see whether last-minute table service ADRs are available, and then scratch that idea because it means eating at Tony&rsquo;s Town Square, and we don&rsquo;t hate ourselves nearly that much. (Joking aside, maybe 2018 will be the year we finally eat there.) In the end, after wasting a bunch of time weighing our options, we just choose Pecos Bill for its toppings bar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are a few solutions to this, but the biggest is going to be grocery delivery (see our&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/groceries-disney-world-buying-tips/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Tips for Grocery Delivery at Walt Disney World</strong></a>&nbsp;post) and having large, healthy breakfasts before leaving our room. Another solution that I plan on implementing to help &ldquo;offset&rdquo; the healthy breakfasts is more desserts from bakeries, which I feel we didn&rsquo;t do enough last year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/coral-reef-epcot-tank.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/coral-reef-epcot-tank.jpg?resize=620%2C398\" style=\"height:399px; width:620px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>6. More Table Service</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; The natural consequence of less counter service is more table service. We also want to do more table service restaurants, as there are several of these we&rsquo;ve never done, or haven&rsquo;t done in a few years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Generally speaking, we enjoy in-park table service restaurants at Walt Disney World much more than counter service ones. In many cases, it seems like the price gap between the two is narrowing. Despite counter service prices increasing dramatically over the last few years, most table service restaurants still have some &lt;$20 entrees, which puts the price gap at only a few dollars in some cases. That far superior experience is well worth the price difference, and that&rsquo;s especially true if we save money by doing large breakfasts at the hotel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5. Disciplined Midday Breaks</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; I&rsquo;m pretty stubborn, a &ldquo;problem&rdquo; that&rsquo;s exacerbated when I&rsquo;m tired. Instead of taking midday breaks when we should have last year, we often found ourselves wandering around in a lethargic daze, too stubborn to leave the parks. We&rsquo;d spend an hour in the DVC Imagination Lounge having coffee and resting, only to fall asleep on the next attraction we did after being &ldquo;recharged.&rdquo; (I fell asleep on Test Track last year.&nbsp;<em>TEST TRACK.</em>)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the past, we&rsquo;ve avoided midday breaks because of the time lost in the transaction: commute, security, showering, and even the time wasted trying to fall asleep (it&rsquo;s always easier in a theater than an actual bed!). However, all of those losses are worth it if our time in the parks is more enjoyable and more efficient, which brings us to the next resolution&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/D75_8294-copy.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/D75_8294-copy.jpg?resize=620%2C404\" style=\"height:404px; width:620px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4. More Rope Drop</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Last year, about the only times we managed to do rope drops were on our arrival days, going immediately from our red-eye flights to the parks. We love early morning in the parks, so this was really disappointing, but jet lag from being three time zones away really doomed our chances of getting up early on other days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This year, we&rsquo;re going to do whatever it takes to be there for rope drop. As we learned from our visit to Japan where we benefited from the time change, those first couple of hours at any park are pure bliss. We want that experience more often, and if we have to sacrifice a few hours in the middle of the day for an early morning, that&rsquo;s a worthwhile trade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. Try New Things</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; This is such a basic, generic one that I&rsquo;m a bit embarrassed to include it so high up the list. The twist here is that we want to try new things&nbsp;<em>without thinking so much about the price.&nbsp;</em>We are pretty open-minded, and willing to try new things we might not enjoy without second thought. When it comes to trying new things, the barrier for us is almost always the price. We are suckers for a good deal, and hesitate when it comes to anything that even might fall short on the value front.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The problem with this approach is that, with few exceptions (looking at you, Tomorrowland Cabanas), you truly don&rsquo;t know whether something is worth the money until you give it a try. We&rsquo;ve wanted to do things like Wild Africa Trek, Dolphins in Depth, unDISCOVERed Future World, and Club Level at Wilderness Lodge or Animal Kingdom Lodge for a while but have hesitated due to value concerns. With the money saved by staying off-site more, we&rsquo;re planning to do more splurging on new-to-us experiences like these.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/sigma-35-disneyland-balloons-girl.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/sigma-35-disneyland-balloons-girl.jpg?resize=392%2C470\" style=\"height:470px; width:392px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. Give Thanks More</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; We wrote an&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/thanking-cast-members/\" target=\"_blank\">entire post thanking Cast Members</a>&nbsp;and reminding others of how important they are to the Disney experience and what they sacrifice to bring magic to guests. That&rsquo;s nice and all, but it&rsquo;s abstract and has no tangible benefit for actual Cast Members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By contrast, going to Guest Services and taking the time to leave &lsquo;Cast Compliments&rsquo; for those who leave a memorable impact on our trips actually does make a difference. These accolades are delivered to Cast Members (and their leaders), and beyond making an individual feel appreciated, they can help with promotions and career advancement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Given that this can also be accomplished by simply tweeting&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/WDWToday\" target=\"_blank\">@WDWToday</a>&nbsp;with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/CastCompliment?src=hash\" target=\"_blank\">#castcompliment</a>, there&rsquo;s no excuse for us not to do more of this. (Even if it does &lsquo;break&rsquo; our next resolution a bit&hellip;)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/disney-battery-chargers-phone-fuelrods-571.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/disney-battery-chargers-phone-fuelrods-571.jpg?zoom=1.25&amp;resize=620%2C431\" style=\"height:430px; width:620px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1. Less Phone &amp; Camera Time</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; I could throw away my camera today (practically speaking, selling it might be a better idea), and still be set for life in terms of Walt Disney World photos. I have tens of thousands of unedited photos sitting on hard drives, a number that only grows with each subsequent trip. Yet, I have this compulsion to keep taking more. It&rsquo;s an addition, really. A totally normal and some might even say healthy one, but an addiction, nonetheless.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have no intentions of taking fewer sunrise, sunset, or night photos, but there&rsquo;s no reason to feel compelled to take more during the middle of the day on attractions. There&rsquo;s also no reason to carry 25 pounds of camera gear every day, and as I get older, I&rsquo;m becoming more acutely aware of the long term toll that could take on my back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for phone time, this is something we&rsquo;re both already pretty good about, but there&rsquo;s always room for improvement. We spend so much time staring at screens in our day-to-day lives that traveling provides a much-needed opportunity to get away from that. Sharing what we&rsquo;re doing in real time via social media means we&rsquo;re less present in the moment, and it equals less real engagement while we&rsquo;re there.</p>\r\n', '10.jpg', 1, 0, '2018-01-12', '01', '2018-01-12 03:58:56', 0),
(11, 17, 'Is Club Level at Walt Disney World Worth It?', '<p>A lot of people have asked us whether Club Level at the various Walt Disney World hotels is worth the money, or a good way to splurge on vacation. We have speculated that Club Level didn&rsquo;t appeal to us from a strict value for money perspective, but of course there&rsquo;s possibly the incalculable x factor of being &lsquo;in da club&rsquo; that may matter, too.&nbsp;Having never stayed Club Level before, we haven&rsquo;t been able to answer this definitely. (<em>Last updated January 10, 2018</em>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>UPDATE:&nbsp;</strong>Starting this Friday (January 12, 2018), Walt Disney World will launch a pilot program with enhanced VIP services for Club Level guests for $50 per person per day, which will include 3 extra FastPass+ entitlements bookable 90 days in advance (with no park restrictions, meaning you could use them for Avatar Flight of Passage, Frozen Ever After, and Seven Dwarfs Mine Train. It will also include VIP viewing for nighttime spectaculars. This will require a minimum three night stay, and must be booked by all guests staying in the room.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There have been rumors of paid FastPass+ for&nbsp;<em>years,&nbsp;</em>and honestly, we expected this a while ago. Certainly, once MaxPass at Disneyland was such a huge success, it was a foregone conclusion that an upcharge FastPass option would come to Walt Disney World.&nbsp;We intend upon analyzing this when it&rsquo;s rolled out further and seeing what kind of impact it has on FastPass+ availability, and then writing a full post on the topic (for now, this is where the topic fit best). While we think this, in isolation, will have a negligible impact on regular guests, it&rsquo;s part of a concerning trend that has larger cumulative implications (with more to come). Stay tuned for more on that, but for now, back to our assessment of whether Club Level at Walt Disney World is worth it&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On our last trip to Walt Disney World, we had the chance to step inside the pearly gates of Club Level lounge access in the&nbsp;King Kamehameha Club. Located in the Hawaii Longhouse of Disney&rsquo;s Polynesian Village Resort, this is one of the premier tiers at Walt Disney World.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, staying Club Level at Disney&rsquo;s Polynesian Village Resort is a costly proposition, with rack rates&nbsp;<em>starting</em>&nbsp;at $700 per night. For reference, we&rsquo;ve stayed at Polynesian Village Resort several times in the last few years, including&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/disneys-polynesian-village-resort-review/\" target=\"_blank\">standard rooms</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/polynesian-bora-bora-bungalows-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Bora Bora Bungalows</a>. We also really like the new Disney Vacation Club studio rooms, and really like the experience of staying at the Polynesian.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As such, staying in the King Kamehameha Club has been on our radar. The main draw of staying Club Level at any Walt Disney World hotel is the lounge. Here, Disney states it &ldquo;includes a variety of Asian-inspired offerings.&rdquo; (Nothing beats the exotic flare&nbsp;of mini corn dogs.) This lounge is open most of the day, with two-story views facing Magic Kingdom, with a perfect view of Cinderella Castle and Happily Ever After!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/polynesian-lobby-fisheye-portrait-copy.jpg\"><img alt=\"polynesian-lobby-fisheye-portrait copy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/polynesian-lobby-fisheye-portrait-copy.jpg?resize=314%2C470\" style=\"height:470px; width:314px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Throughout the day, the lounge serves the following: Kakahiaka &ndash; continental breakfast, 7-10:30 a.m.;&nbsp;Auinala &ndash; afternoon refreshments,&nbsp;12-4 p.m.;&nbsp;Ahiahi &ndash; appetizers, wine, and cheese selections, 5-7 p.m.;&nbsp;Aumoe &ndash; Desserts &amp; cordials,&nbsp;8-10 p.m. Even in between these gaps, soda was in the fridge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to access to the&nbsp;King Kamehameha Club Lounge, guests staying Club Level have access to the Club Concierge Cast Members between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m. These Cast Members in the first floor of the Hawaii building can assist with tickets, dining, recreation, transportation, child care, and daily itinerary planning. (The next 3 photos are inside the two stories of the Club Level Lounge.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/King-Kamehameha-Club-level-disney-world-polynesian-resort-hotel-017.jpg\"><img alt=\"King-Kamehameha-Club-level-disney-world-polynesian-resort-hotel-017\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/King-Kamehameha-Club-level-disney-world-polynesian-resort-hotel-017.jpg?resize=620%2C414\" style=\"height:414px; width:620px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the interest of full disclosure, we did not stay Club Level at the Polynesian ourselves. We were invited up for the afternoon by&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.easywdw.com/easy/\" target=\"_blank\">Josh from easyWDW</a>. From what I understand, Josh used the proceeds from pawning his Canon to fund a lavish night in the King Kamehameha Club. (I assume he got the other $696.50 by hawking&nbsp;<a href=\"http://amzn.to/2aElm2k\" target=\"_blank\">bootleg Bojack Horseman hats</a>, but I want to maintain plausible deniability, so I didn&rsquo;t ask.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Joking(?) aside, Josh was checking out&nbsp;King Kamehameha Club as part of a stay booked by&nbsp;<a href=\"http://yourfirstvisit.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Dave of YourFirstVisit</a>, as the two prepared updates for&nbsp;<a href=\"http://amzn.to/2awF5OS\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The easy Guide to Your Walt Disney World Visit</em></a>. Sarah and I made the literal faustian bargain of having to listen to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.easywdw.com/easy/blog/yak-yeti-american-kobe-beef-hot-dog-and-cheeseburger-review-plus-avatar-construction-animal-kingdom-71716/\" target=\"_blank\">Josh rant about kobe beef hot dogs</a>&nbsp;for hours in exchange for first-hand Club Level access without having to splurge on it ourselves. I&rsquo;m still not sure the value proposition of not paying worked in our favor, but&nbsp;<em>you&rsquo;re welcome</em>&nbsp;for our sacrifice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/King-Kamehameha-Club-level-disney-world-polynesian-resort-hotel-019.jpg\"><img alt=\"King-Kamehameha-Club-level-disney-world-polynesian-resort-hotel-019\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/King-Kamehameha-Club-level-disney-world-polynesian-resort-hotel-019.jpg?resize=620%2C406\" style=\"height:406px; width:620px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Objectively, the cost of staying Club Level at the Polynesian ranges from around +$175/night to +$350/night depending on room tier and season. The difference is greater for theme park view rooms during higher rate seasons. For the simplicity&rsquo;s sake, let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;ll cost $200/night more to stay Club Level at the Poly, which is a conservative estimate that assumes a lower tier room and perhaps&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/room-discounts-dates-tips-disney-world/\" target=\"_blank\">a room-only discount</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Assuming you cram 4 adults in the Club Level room&ndash;because nothing&nbsp;says posh&nbsp;hotel stay&nbsp;like 4 adults in one hotel room&ndash;you&rsquo;re looking at $50 per person, per night for Club Level. If you do 3 meals at Captain Cook&rsquo;s per day that cost around $15 each, you&rsquo;re already at around $45. Add even a single beer to that, and you&rsquo;re over $50.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/King-Kamehameha-Club-level-disney-world-polynesian-resort-hotel-018.jpg\"><img alt=\"King-Kamehameha-Club-level-disney-world-polynesian-resort-hotel-018\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/King-Kamehameha-Club-level-disney-world-polynesian-resort-hotel-018.jpg?resize=620%2C413\" style=\"height:414px; width:620px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Add a great lounge for viewing Happily Ever After and a&nbsp;few<em>&nbsp;</em>beers to that, and you&rsquo;re looking at $75. Maybe think of the Club Level experience with its all-you-can-eat lounge as more comparable to &lsquo;Ohana, and you&rsquo;re looking at $150 per person after drinks. Club Level at the Poly is a no-brainer, must-do at this point, right?&nbsp;<em>RIGHT?!</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you slow down the tortured math train, the wheels fall off. If I don&rsquo;t die of laughter first, the next time someone compares Club Level to a Walt Disney World buffet (<em>next</em>&nbsp;time because it has happened before&ndash;more than once, in fact), I will calmly explain that the quality of food at&nbsp;King Kamehameha Club is not in the same ballpark, league, or even the same sport as &lsquo;Ohana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/King-Kamehameha-Club-level-disney-world-polynesian-resort-hotel-016.jpg\"><img alt=\"King-Kamehameha-Club-level-disney-world-polynesian-resort-hotel-016\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/King-Kamehameha-Club-level-disney-world-polynesian-resort-hotel-016.jpg?resize=620%2C423\" style=\"height:423px; width:620px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The food in King Kamehameha Club had me longing for the End Zone Food Court at All Star Sports, and it&rsquo;s a stretch to compare the lounge&rsquo;s food quality to even Captain Cook&rsquo;s. Highlights of the dinner spread included partially-frozen corn dogs and bacon-wrapped something, but the true &ldquo;winner&rdquo; was the cheese cubes, which were probably Sargento purchased in bulk. (Honestly, I&rsquo;d just be happy if they were actually made of cheese.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anywhere else, these cubes would&rsquo;ve only been the winner in the &ldquo;participant medal&rdquo; sense of the term. If you&rsquo;re looking at Club Level from a value perspective, you would come out so far ahead to just do&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/groceries-disney-world-buying-tips/\" target=\"_blank\">grocery delivery and have&nbsp;snacks at your leisure in your Walt Disney World hotel room</a>. You could do better quality for significantly less money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/King-Kamehameha-Club-level-disney-world-polynesian-resort-hotel-015.jpg\"><img alt=\"King-Kamehameha-Club-level-disney-world-polynesian-resort-hotel-015\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/King-Kamehameha-Club-level-disney-world-polynesian-resort-hotel-015.jpg?resize=620%2C411\" style=\"height:411px; width:620px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the drink front, things were significantly better. There were a variety of wines and beers&ndash;and not just BMC piss water. There were also a variety of non-alcoholic options including Coke, coffee, and&ndash;most importantly&ndash;POG juice. So, it wasn&rsquo;t all bad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We didn&rsquo;t stick around for the fireworks this time, but we watched from&nbsp;the Club Lounge a couple of years ago, and I the desserts then were pretty good, too. So it isn&rsquo;t&nbsp;<em>all&nbsp;</em>mediocre.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/King-Kamehameha-Club-level-disney-world-polynesian-resort-hotel-024.jpg\"><img alt=\"King-Kamehameha-Club-level-disney-world-polynesian-resort-hotel-024\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/King-Kamehameha-Club-level-disney-world-polynesian-resort-hotel-024.jpg?resize=620%2C418\" style=\"height:418px; width:620px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the sake of argument, let&rsquo;s say you enjoy the Club Lounge food and are willing to assign it the same value as a meal at Captain Cook&rsquo;s or some other counter service restaurant. Are you really willing to be at the hotel for 3 meals per day? Unless you are doing a split stay with only a night or two staying Club Level on non-park days (the best way to do it, in my opinion), you&rsquo;re probably also doing the Walt Disney World parks while staying Club Level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Continental (read: cold items only) breakfast here is the easy one to hit, since you can grab that before heading to the parks. It&rsquo;s really convenient, and arguably the best perk of staying Club Level. Lunch and dinner, however, are both in the middle of the day, with the light dinner spread ending at 7 p.m. before the evening desserts start. Realistically, unless you&rsquo;re lounging around the hotel all day, you&rsquo;re most likely looking at doing breakfast and desserts at the hotel most days. Even if you are lounging around the hotel all day, dining at Captain Cook&rsquo;s is a far tastier proposition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/King-Kamehameha-Club-level-disney-world-polynesian-resort-hotel-020.jpg\"><img alt=\"King-Kamehameha-Club-level-disney-world-polynesian-resort-hotel-020\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/King-Kamehameha-Club-level-disney-world-polynesian-resort-hotel-020.jpg?resize=274%2C470\" style=\"height:470px; width:274px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After spending a few hours grazing the afternoon and dinner spreads at&nbsp;King Kamehameha Club, I can say&ndash;without question&ndash;that there is no scenario that doesn&rsquo;t require incredibly tortured logic for Club Level to be a &ldquo;good value.&rdquo; Short of&nbsp;hosting a beer pong tournament in your room and only being willing to use Kona Longboard Lager sourced from the hotel, or some other special circumstances, the math simply does not&nbsp;compute.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I fixate on the numbers above because I see these come up a lot when people are trying to justify Club Level&ndash;that they can &ldquo;make it work&rdquo; by doing meals in the Club. However, guests contemplating Club Level might not be resorting to &ldquo;making it work&rdquo; to justify the experience of Club Level&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/King-Kamehameha-Club-level-disney-world-polynesian-resort-hotel-022.jpg\"><img alt=\"King-Kamehameha-Club-level-disney-world-polynesian-resort-hotel-022\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/King-Kamehameha-Club-level-disney-world-polynesian-resort-hotel-022.jpg?resize=620%2C411\" style=\"height:411px; width:620px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead,&nbsp;they may be considering the concierge service and pampering that&ndash;presumably&ndash;come with staying Club Level. I&rsquo;d assume a decent&nbsp;chunk of Club Level guests are first-timers doing a one-and-done Walt Disney World vacation. Probably affluent, perhaps&nbsp;with status at a major chain, and used to staying Concierge Level and having access to those lounges and amenities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If that more or less describes you, or&nbsp;you&rsquo;re considering Club Level at Walt Disney World because you assume it&rsquo;s on par with concierge experiences at other hotels, let me assure you: it&rsquo;s not even remotely comparable. We have stayed at Grand Club level at several Hyatt hotels, among other chains, and the difference at&nbsp;luxury hotels is that the service there is actually commensurate with the cost (although we have&nbsp;<em>never&nbsp;</em>paid anywhere close to +$200 for it)&nbsp;and the lounge refreshments are incredibly high caliber.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Real world concierges can pull strings and make coveted bookings, quickly have tickets delivered to a hotel, etc. Walt Disney World concierges can make the same bookings available in the My Disney Experience&nbsp;app in lieu of you doing it. This can be a nice convenience, but it&rsquo;s nothing you couldn&rsquo;t do&ndash;or&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/authorized-disney-vacation-planner-reasons-why/\" target=\"_blank\">have an Authorized Disney Vacation Planner do for you (for free)</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/King-Kamehameha-Club-level-disney-world-polynesian-resort-hotel-021.jpg\"><img alt=\"King-Kamehameha-Club-level-disney-world-polynesian-resort-hotel-021\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/King-Kamehameha-Club-level-disney-world-polynesian-resort-hotel-021.jpg?resize=620%2C414\" style=\"height:414px; width:620px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In general, this is a fundamental difference that really must be stressed for Walt Disney World first-timers weighing hotel options. Disney does a lot of things incredibly well, but luxury hotel service is typically not among them. From the shared buses (really?!) to not shifting the best-performing Cast Members to the Deluxes, this is demonstrated in a variety of ways. We&rsquo;ve stayed at every Walt Disney World hotel, and while service can be good at any of them, we have never noted a marked difference between Value Resorts and Deluxe Resorts on that front.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At Walt Disney World, you are paying for location and theming when it comes to hotels, and you should not expect a top-to-bottom experience on par with what you would receive for the same &ldquo;real world&rdquo; price points. If you pampered service is your paramount concern, you are better off booking the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/waldorf-astoria-orlando-hotel-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Waldorf Astoria Orlando</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"http://yourfirstvisit.net/2014/09/22/review-four-seasons-resort-orlando-at-walt-disney-world/\" target=\"_blank\">Four Seasons Resort Orlando</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/King-Kamehameha-Club-level-disney-world-polynesian-resort-hotel-025.jpg\"><img alt=\"King-Kamehameha-Club-level-disney-world-polynesian-resort-hotel-025\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/King-Kamehameha-Club-level-disney-world-polynesian-resort-hotel-025.jpg?resize=620%2C422\" style=\"height:422px; width:620px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With all of that said, absent an exceptional discount or other special situation, there is really only one tenable justification for staying Club Level at Walt Disney World: because you just want to do it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because you want to watch Happily Ever After from the&nbsp;King Kamehameha Club and take an intermission for an impromptu Kona Longboard Lager. Because you want the convenience of breezing through the Club Lounge in your building at 7 a.m. for breakfast while getting ready, rather than fighting crowds in Captain Cook&rsquo;s or having to deal with groceries in your room. Because you want to strut around in your lei&nbsp;like a rockstar&ndash;a modern day Jon Bon Jovi&ndash;as you splurge on a bit of luxury. Because it&rsquo;s just something you flat out want to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Everyone&nbsp;</em>makes purchases that would not pass muster if scrutinized from a value for money perspective. There&rsquo;s absolutely nothing wrong with that. There&rsquo;s no reason to feel bad about wanting what you think will be a cool or convenient experience for the sake of that experience. Anyone who claims they aren&rsquo;t influenced by a desire for some&nbsp;luxury or feelings of emotion is lying. If you want to stay Club Level at Walt Disney World for one of these reasons&ndash;or some other intrinsic sense of happiness&ndash;more power to you. (Honestly, even after this experience, I&nbsp;<em>still&nbsp;</em>want to stay a night at Club Level sometime.)&nbsp;Only you know what will make your vacation special to you, so don&rsquo;t listen to how others might feel.</p>\r\n', '11.jpg', 3, 0, '2018-01-12', '01', '2018-01-12 03:59:56', 0),
(13, 4, 'Hotel New York Review', '<p>Hotel New York is a hotel at Disneyland Paris, designed by Michael Graves and occupying the top tier of Disney hotels at the resort. This review features room photos from the hotel, along with thoughts on its quality and my experience of staying at the hotel. (<em>Last updated January 9, 2018.</em>)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2018 UPDATE:&nbsp;</strong>Disney&rsquo;s Hotel New York is closing in October 2018 with a top to bottom refurbishment that will transform it into&nbsp;<em>Disney&rsquo;s Hotel New York</em>&nbsp;<em>&ndash; The Art of Marvel.&nbsp;</em>The idea is that this hotel will transport guests to the action-packed, inspiring world of Super Heroes including Iron Man, The Avengers, and Spider Man among others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We previously reported that an 18-month top to bottom overhaul of Hotel New York would be occurring, and while we don&rsquo;t know if 18 months is still the plan, we do know that Disneyland Paris intends upon reopening at some point in 2020. If you want to get one last stay in at the &ldquo;original&rdquo; Hotel New York, you had better do so soon. Then again, after reading the rest of this review, you may not want to&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hotel New York is about a 10 minute walk from Disneyland Paris, making it the second-closest hotel to Disneyland Paris and the Walt Disney Studios Park after Disneyland Hotel. A shuttle is also offered from the hotel to the parks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With regard to class, Disney categorizes it as a &ldquo;4 keys/stars&rdquo; hotel, making it the second highest priced and second nicest in terms of their tiering.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s start out the review with a look at Hotel New York&rsquo;s theme and atmosphere&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"DSC_4182 as Smart Object-1\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/DSC_4182-as-Smart-Object-1.jpg?resize=620%2C426\" style=\"height:426px; width:620px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of late, there has been a rise in theme park lands that give guests the opportunity to step into their favorite stories, and be an active &ldquo;participant&rdquo; in the scene. With the hit 1990s sitcom Friends recently finding a brand new audience via Netflix, I think now is the time for Hotel New York to really cash in and be the first&nbsp;<em>hotel</em>&nbsp;that allows guests to step into the story.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is (probably) a huge segment of the population that pines for the opportunity to set foot in Central Perk, dance in a fountain with their BFFs while The Rembrandts play in the background, and otherwise partake in the golden age of the Big Apple: 1994. Marketing genius that I am, if I were in charge of Disneyland Paris, I would change the name of Hotel New York to &ldquo;Friends Season 1: The Hotel.&rdquo; Now, I realize Hotel New York&rsquo;s design actually dates before 1994, but I think it can pass for that glorious era.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This would obviate the need to update this woefully dated hotel, and hit that huge niche of people who want to go back in time and be a part of that amazing time in the Big Apple for those mischievous&nbsp;friends. Change the name on the marquee, maybe offer some Central Perk brand coffee, have the male Cast Members die their hair like Gunther and the female CMs get &ldquo;The Rachel&rdquo; haircut, and call it a day. Done and done. Maybe there could even be some Seinfeld tie-ins. Pirate shirts in lieu of robes in every closet!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In all seriousness, the datedness of this hotel is its principle problem, in my eyes. Judging by&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1182377-d262678-Reviews-or10-Disney_s_Hotel_New_York-Chessy_Marne_la_Vallee_Seine_et_Marne_Ile_de_France.html#REVIEWS\" target=\"_blank\">TripAdvisor reviews</a>, almost none of which mention this issue (with most being resoundingly positive), perhaps I&rsquo;m more sensitive to it than other travelers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can judge for yourself if you think the datedness of the hotel is a big deal in the photos here, but know they only tell part of the story&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"DSC_4191 as Smart Object-1\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/DSC_4191-as-Smart-Object-1.jpg?resize=620%2C435\" style=\"height:435px; width:620px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The circa-1992 style is apparent as soon as you get to the check-in desk. The apples on the back wall have a style that look like they&rsquo;d be a perfect fit for the opening scenes of Saved by the Bell. Now, you might think that this is a minor thing and it doesn&rsquo;t look&nbsp;<em>that&nbsp;</em>bad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Keep in mind that this is purportedly a luxury hotel where rooms&nbsp;<em>start&nbsp;</em>at the equivalent of around $500/night. For that price point, it is wholly unacceptable for it to still be stuck in 1992. That&rsquo;s nearly 25 years without any substantial updates to many areas of the hotel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other areas of the lobby don&rsquo;t look as bad, and have the distinct look of something designed by Michael Graves. It&rsquo;s probably hard to tell from this photo, but there is this interesting, Art Deco meets neon look to much of the hotel. I don&rsquo;t know what that&rsquo;s about, but I suppose there are worse styles&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Hotel New York Mets\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Hotel-New-York-Mets.jpg?resize=620%2C466\" style=\"height:466px; width:620px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are Mets and the Yankees logos on the floor of the lobby, and nods throughout the hotel to various aspects of New York City. This is all pretty cool, and if I were a European who had never been to New York City, it would probably be pretty cool to see all of this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aside from the New York City Bar, where I ate dinner each night after returning from the parks, I didn&rsquo;t sample the other restaurants in the hotel. I did enjoy New York City Bar, and found the service there to be impeccable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"DSC_4173 as Smart Object-1\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/DSC_4173-as-Smart-Object-1.jpg?resize=620%2C435\" style=\"height:435px; width:620px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Outside of the hotel at Christmas there is ice skating in the style of Rockefeller Center, which is a nice touch. I&rsquo;m actually a fan of the general style of the exterior. While it does look distinctly like a Michael Graves creation, and has a certain coldness to it, so long as &ldquo;New York&rdquo; is the theme, I don&rsquo;t know how else the hotel could be designed to that theme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It has a certain post-modern and almost abstract look that does effectively evoke that look. Perhaps it could use a refresh in terms of color scheme and a good power-wash, but I think overall, the exterior works. It&rsquo;s not my personal cup of tea thematically, but I can&rsquo;t knock it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/bed-table-window-hotel-new-york-disneyland-paris.jpg\"><img alt=\"bed-table-window-hotel-new-york-disneyland-paris\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/bed-table-window-hotel-new-york-disneyland-paris.jpg?resize=620%2C414\" style=\"height:414px; width:620px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>My room in Hotel New York was one of the &ldquo;Empire State Club Lake View&rdquo; rooms. For my stay, the approximate cost of this club level room would have been around $650-700/night. (In the interest of full disclosure, I did not pay for my room.) Club level gets you&nbsp;exclusive check-in, access to the Empire State Club lounge for breakfast and snacks, VIP FastPass, and &ldquo;additional services,&rdquo; whatever that means.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To start, I am not a proponent of club level or concierge at any Disney hotel, and would never book this category of rooms if paying myself. As compared to real world hotels, I think Disney concierges don&rsquo;t offer the same level of service and expertise, nor do they have connections to &ldquo;hook you up,&rdquo; as the kids say. Likewise, club level lounges often lack the amenities found in their real world counterparts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With that said, I went in with an open mind, but Hotel New York vindicated my thinking on this. While the Empire State Club served a nice selection of light snacks, meats, and cheeses, it felt like a slightly upscale version of the breakfast normally offered at the hotel. I think club level here offers poor value for money, unless you have a large party and you&rsquo;re going at such a busy time that those VIP FastPasses will come in handy (crowds were so light that I didn&rsquo;t even use them).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, you might say that anyone shelling out $700/night for a hotel room isn&rsquo;t concerned with value for money, but I&rsquo;d counter by saying that many well-off individuals didn&rsquo;t get to be that way by spending recklessly. I suppose your mileage may vary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/hotel-new-york-bed-couch.jpg\"><img alt=\"hotel-new-york-bed-couch\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/hotel-new-york-bed-couch.jpg?resize=620%2C414\" style=\"height:414px; width:620px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for the quality of the room, I think it pretty well speaks for itself in these photos. Worth noting is that the bedding and pillows were extremely nice. This was the high point of the room, and a stark contrast to the hard bedding found at Sequoia Lodge in our previous stay there. Based on photos I&rsquo;ve seen of the rooms previously, I&rsquo;d say the bedding has been redone in the last year or so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/hotel-new-york-desk-tv.jpg\"><img alt=\"hotel-new-york-desk-tv\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/hotel-new-york-desk-tv.jpg?resize=620%2C414\" style=\"height:414px; width:620px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aside from the bedding, the room felt dated. The furniture seemed worse for wear, and the general style and visual motifs (those darned apples!) looked like it was stuck in 1992. Even the television was old! (Presumably because modern LCD televisions are widescreen and wouldn&rsquo;t fit in the cabinet. On the plus side, there was an excellent little espresso machine in the room. That was probably the second best part of the room after the bedding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The third best part about the room is the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAynEA0UlpU\" target=\"_blank\">&rsquo;10 Things to Know Before You Go&rsquo; with Sophie</a>, who is basically the Disneyland Paris version of Stacey. This station was always on whenever I was in the room. SORTED!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"hotel-new-york-disneyland-paris-503\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/hotel-new-york-disneyland-paris-503.jpg?resize=620%2C418\" style=\"height:418px; width:620px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bathroom was likewise dated, albeit clean and well-maintained. I&rsquo;m not sure what the deal with it was, but the bathtub was incredibly deep.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I had to take a running start and leap over the edge just to get into the shower. Kidding, but I really have no clue why this thing is so deep.&nbsp;I&rsquo;d say perhaps it&rsquo;s a&nbsp;French thing, but I haven&rsquo;t noticed it elsewhere in France.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/hotel-new-york-disneyland-paris-502.jpg\"><img alt=\"hotel-new-york-disneyland-paris-502\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/hotel-new-york-disneyland-paris-502.jpg?resize=339%2C470\" style=\"height:470px; width:339px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To the room&rsquo;s credit, it was incredibly clean and even though the style felt like it was straight out of the early-90s, aside from the furniture, it was all very well maintained. Either a good job is done with maintenance, or these rooms have been refurbished with the same design retained. I&rsquo;m not sure which, but I guess kudos in that regard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, I think Hotel New York offers the absolute worst value for money of any Disney hotel, anywhere. Even the overpriced Grand Floridian is significantly better in that regard. Hotel New York is simply too dated and doesn&rsquo;t offer a compelling &ldquo;hook&rdquo; to make that datedness forgivable. The hotel does have potential if it receives a top-to-bottom refurbishment (as seems to be the trend with Disneyland Paris hotels), so maybe within the next couple of years it can modernize and really offer an urbane and contemporary take on the Big Apple&hellip;because the cutesy little apples everywhere in the hotel simply don&rsquo;t do the trick.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I hate to be so hard on the hotel, especially given that Disneyland Paris is a common whipping boy for so many Disney fans, but this hotel just doesn&rsquo;t pass muster for me. Despite all of its faults, I actually am a huge fan of Disneyland Paris, and I am rooting for it to turn a corner and become the world-class destination I know it can be. For those wanting some practical advice, rather than staying at Hotel New York, I would book a room at Disneyland Hotel (if money is no object) or Sequoia Lodge (I&rsquo;m a big fan of that hotel&ndash;<a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/sequoia-lodge-review/\" target=\"_blank\">read my Sequoia Lodge Review for more info</a>). The former offers an unparalleled experience and has really grown on me as I&rsquo;ve explored it more, and the latter is a great hotel, especially after its recent refurbishment. Disneyland Paris discounts are abundant, so it&rsquo;s unlikely you&rsquo;re going to pay the rack rates I&rsquo;ve listed here, but I wouldn&rsquo;t stay at Hotel New York for even half those prices&ndash;and if Hotel New York is offering discounts, so too will the cheaper and superior Sequoia Lodge.</p>\r\n', '13.jpg', 1, 0, '2018-01-14', '01', '2018-01-14 17:13:07', 1);

(14, 4, 'Best and Worst Months to Visit Disney World in 2018', '<p>A lot of resources exist to choose&nbsp;the best time to visit Walt Disney World. From statistical crowd calendars to special events schedules to park hours, and more, there&rsquo;s no shortage of information to help guests make informed decisions. (<em>Last updated January 3, 2018</em>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Walt Disney World crowd calendars are&nbsp;<em>really&nbsp;</em>popular among trip planner, we believe a more holistic approach to planning when to visit based on other comfort and enjoyment factors&nbsp;in addition to crowd calendar stats&nbsp;is a more pragmatic approach to choosing dates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Low crowds during a time when temperatures are sweltering, humidity is off the charts and there are no special events should not trump moderate crowds during a temperate time of year with a special event. Few people evaluate their vacation&rsquo;s success by some statistical &lsquo;fun quotient&rsquo;, so why not do likewise when planning, and perform a qualitative analysis when&nbsp;choosing travel dates?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s our approach, at least, and one that has proven popular with readers of our&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/when-to-visit-disney-world/\" target=\"_blank\">When to Visit Walt Disney World</a></strong>&nbsp;post, which we felt only scratched the surface of what people should be considering before choosing their dates. To provide additional we began writing monthly guides to delve into each month in greater depth.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/tag/month-overviews/\" target=\"_blank\">These monthly Walt Disney World guides</a>&nbsp;offer overviews of crowd levels for the month, what weather and temperatures to expect, special events occurring during the month, and historical information on the availability of discounts and pricing patterns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this post, we seek to offer context to the monthly guides by sharing our own variation of a crowd calendar for Walt Disney World. Not one based purely in statistics, but also in qualitative factors. The goal of our Walt Disney World crowd calendar is to rank every month and give a bit of insight into which times within the month are best&hellip;and&nbsp;<em>why&nbsp;</em>we like or dislike each month. Sometimes, it&rsquo;s due to crowds, sometimes it&rsquo;s weather or other factors. (As such, calling this a crowd calendar is a bit of a misnomer, but you get the idea.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With all of that said, we do think crowd calendars have value, too. Unfortunately, even though we make regular trips to Walt Disney World, visiting 6 months out of the year in an average year, we don&rsquo;t have the expertise to offer a day-by-day crowd calendar. Perhaps if we were locals or had strong statistical models, but we are not and do not. Instead, if you&rsquo;re looking for a daily crowd calendar, we recommend checking out out&nbsp;<a href=\"http://touringplans.com/\" target=\"_blank\">TouringPlans</a>&nbsp;for that, as they have reliable crowd calendars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyway, to cut to the chase, the point of this post is to rank every month of the year for visiting Walt Disney World in light of&nbsp;<em>all variables</em>&nbsp;that (we feel) are important. We feel that this offers a much more helpful resource to everyone planning Walt Disney World vacations, and you can adapt it to your circumstances as you see fit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/sarah-tom-bricker-photopass-festival-arts-brushes.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/sarah-tom-bricker-photopass-festival-arts-brushes.jpg?zoom=1.25&amp;resize=620%2C429\" style=\"height:429px; width:620px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a slight spike in crowds during the winter and spring, early summer crowds were below average for the second year in a row at Walt Disney World. This follows lower than normal crowds last summer, which ended up rising when &ldquo;Peak Season&rdquo; pricing ended towards the end of August. We explain this trend in crowds in our new post: &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/summer-not-peak-season-disney-world-crowd-trends/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Summer Is Not Busy Season at Walt Disney World Anymore</strong></a>.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crowds got progressively heavier as the summer progressed, with some of the worst crowds of the year in October. Thus far, November has been more or less normal, and we expect the same from December. Basically, spikes in crowd levels for the holiday weeks and a few other pockets of crowds, but otherwise moderate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest crowd trends the last couple of years have been the busier fall months (October, especially) and less busy summer months.&nbsp;In our most recent update to this post for January 2018, we&rsquo;ve gone back and updated each of the month by month overviews taking these recent crowd trends into account. You can read more in-depth descriptions about each month by clicking the month name below, which will open that page in a new tab&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/FM76689-as-Smart-Object-1-copy.jpg\"><img alt=\"Mission: Space at Night\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/FM76689-as-Smart-Object-1-copy.jpg?resize=620%2C409\" style=\"height:408px; width:620px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>12.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/august-disney-world/\" target=\"_blank\">August</a></strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Feel like Mission: Space is insufficient at simulating a visit to Mars? Then you&rsquo;ll love August in Walt Disney World, when every day feels like a veritable trip to the red planet! Hot, humid, stormy weather typifies August in Central Florida, and that alone makes August the worst month to visit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The last week of August is potentially&nbsp;<em>the</em>&nbsp;qualitatively worst week of year to visit Walt Disney World. In addition to the weather, it marks the end of &ldquo;Peak Season&rdquo; ticket prices, meaning people who postponed their visits to save money will start heading to the parks. On top of that, both Halloween and Epcot Food &amp; Wine Festival &ldquo;seasons&rdquo; start at the end of August, which could result in a spike at both Magic Kingdom and Epcot. It should still only be moderate in terms of crowds, but still worse than the two months that preceded it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/to-honor-america-cast-bokeh-july-disney-world.jpg\"><img alt=\"to-honor-america-cast-bokeh-july-disney-world\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/to-honor-america-cast-bokeh-july-disney-world.jpg?resize=620%2C421\" style=\"height:421px; width:620px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>11.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/july-disney-world/\" target=\"_blank\">July</a></strong>&nbsp;&ndash; If you have no other options, perhaps you can feel better about a July trip to Walt Disney World by considering it your patriotic duty to go for Independence Day? (Just play a lot of Buzz Lightyear&rsquo;s Space Ranger Spin, and pretend you&rsquo;re saving Earth, Big Willie&nbsp;Style.) Another upside is that for two consecutive summers, we&rsquo;ve seen below average crowd levels, so we&rsquo;re now prepared to call that the &ldquo;new normal.&rdquo; Crowds&nbsp;will spike around Independence Day, the upside there is added entertainment and special fireworks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, July is not a good month to visit if only because of heat and humidity. Once you plan for the weather realities of a summer trip, remember that &ldquo;even a rainy, potentially crowded day at Walt Disney World is better than a perfect day at home&rdquo; so you don&rsquo;t get too down on trip.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/typhoon-lagoon-sunset-orton.jpg\"><img alt=\"typhoon-lagoon-sunset-orton\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/typhoon-lagoon-sunset-orton.jpg?resize=620%2C419\" style=\"height:419px; width:620px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>10.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/june-disney-world/\" target=\"_blank\">June</a></strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Another summer month, another low spot on the list. The upside to June is that, like July, summer crowds are seemingly now a thing of the past (at least until Walt Disney World self-corrects with pricing model changes). The downside to June&ndash;in addition to the heat&ndash;is the rain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The average monthly rainfall in June at Walt Disney World is over 8+ inches, and the probability of rain on any given day is above 50%. June is the first month of the year that we see hotel choice (particularly in terms of pool-quality and proximity to the parks) really making a big difference, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/roger-rabbit-wide-close-disneyland-easter.jpg\"><img alt=\"roger-rabbit-wide-close-disneyland-easter\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/roger-rabbit-wide-close-disneyland-easter-300x449.jpg?resize=300%2C449\" style=\"height:449px; width:300px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>9.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/april-disney-world/\" target=\"_blank\">April</a></strong>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;James Franco could make a sequel to&nbsp;<em>Spring Breakers&nbsp;</em>set at Walt Disney World, and it would make the events of the original film seem perfectly tame. Okay, maybe not, but that doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that Spring Break at Walt Disney World is a time to be avoided if you can. Ranking April is tricky. If Easter is in March, April leapfrogs both March and May as a better month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, our current rankings are based upon April 2018. Given that Easter will be in April next year (and every year until 2024), it&rsquo;s a month that we recommend avoiding if you don&rsquo;t like long lines. The entire month will be above average, but the weeks abutting Easter will be DEFCON 1. You&rsquo;d better be ready for some intense hand to hand combat when racing to Frozen Ever After at rope drop!&nbsp;<img alt=\"ðŸ˜‰\" src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/svg/1f609.svg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/cinderella-castle-morning-light-sunrise.jpg\"><img alt=\"cinderella-castle-morning-light-sunrise\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/cinderella-castle-morning-light-sunrise.jpg?resize=620%2C397\" style=\"height:397px; width:620px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>8.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/may-disney-world/\" target=\"_blank\">May</a></strong>&nbsp;&ndash; After our descriptions for June, July, and August that weren&rsquo;t exactly ringing endorsements, you might have similar worries about May. Fortunately, it isn&rsquo;t as bad, particularly earlier in the month. In fact, there&rsquo;s a decent amount of upside as May marks the transition to summer, with park hours becoming longer and whatever new entertainment is on-tap for summer typically debuting by or before Memorial Day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crowds (aside from Memorial Day weekend) are fairly average in May. You have some people trying to beat the Peak Season pricing, while others cannot visit before school is out. The downside is that heat and humidity can really start intensifying in May, and this is the first month of the year during which it&rsquo;s not uncommon to see the temperatures broach 90-degrees and the humidity reach high levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/dusk-main-street-ghost-guests-halloween-party.jpg\"><img alt=\"dusk-main-street-ghost-guests-halloween-party\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/dusk-main-street-ghost-guests-halloween-party.jpg?resize=620%2C397\" style=\"height:397px; width:620px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>7.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/october-disney-world/\" target=\"_blank\">October</a></strong>&nbsp;&ndash; With each update to this post, October drops. If we were making this list 5 or so years ago, there would have been a solid argument for placing October in the #1 spot. Markedly improved&nbsp;weather as compared to September plus Halloween and Food &amp; Wine Festival in full swing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nowadays, everyone and their brother seems to be celebrating Columbus Day,&nbsp;Rosh Hashanah, Halloween, Sweetest Day, National Dessert Day (<em><a href=\"https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2015/10/8-disney-parks-recipes-to-celebrate-national-dessert-day/?comment_sort=asc\" target=\"_blank\">of course</a>&nbsp;</em>Disney celebrates this one),&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lifewithheidi.com/bologna-day/\" target=\"_blank\">National Bologna Day</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.today.com/food/its-national-moldy-cheese-day-try-these-3-surprising-blue-2D80202883\" target=\"_blank\">Moldy Cheese Day</a>, and a whole host of other random holidays. Or maybe it&rsquo;s an increase in schools having staggered fall breaks throughout the month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Irrespective of why, October is now the busiest month of the year at Walt Disney World in terms of average wait times. It&rsquo;s so busy that the entire month is blocked out for Free Dining and other discounts are difficult to find. The crowd levels coupled with lack of discounts push October into the middle of the pack. While it doesn&rsquo;t see the same obscene wait times as New Year&rsquo;s Eve or Christmas week, October is a month that is&nbsp;<em>consistently&nbsp;</em>busy, with no real reprieve. If you don&rsquo;t mind rolling the dice a bit on weather, you should visit during September if you&rsquo;re choosing a fall month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/DSC_9595-as-Smart-Object-1-copy.jpg\"><img alt=\"Epcot Flower &amp; Garden Festival 2012 Monorail\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/DSC_9595-as-Smart-Object-1-copy.jpg?resize=620%2C411\" style=\"height:410px; width:620px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>6.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/march-disney-world/\" target=\"_blank\">March</a></strong>&nbsp;&ndash; At schools that don&rsquo;t use&nbsp;the Easter holiday as a proxy for their Spring Break dates, the bulk of these breaks fall in March. Easter does not fall in March again until 2024 (although in 2018 it&rsquo;s on April 1) and most schools use Easter as a proxy for their Spring Break, meaning that March is normally the less-common Spring Break month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still,&nbsp;March is above-average in terms of crowds due to early (and college) Spring Breaks. It&nbsp;becomes the most crowded month on the rare years that Easter falls within the month. Aside from crowds, weather is typically temperate by March, as evidenced by the start of Epcot&rsquo;s International Flower &amp; Garden Festival at the beginning of the month. Regardless of the year, we are big fans of the late February, early March dates as a great time for cool weather, low to moderate crowds, and Epcot coming into bloom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/DSC_3952-as-Smart-Object-1-copy.jpg\"><img alt=\"Cinderella Castle Infrared - Walt Disney World\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/DSC_3952-as-Smart-Object-1-copy.jpg?resize=311%2C450\" style=\"height:450px; width:311px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/january-disney-world/\" target=\"_blank\">January</a></strong>&nbsp;&ndash; In our full post, we describe January as the &ldquo;holiday hangover&rdquo; at Walt Disney World, and that&rsquo;s perfectly apt. It&rsquo;s sort of like Walt Disney World ate too many Christmas cookies and is too lazy to get off the couch and take down the decorations, with this mentality continuing long after the tree is dead to the point where its wife is embarrassed when it finally throws out the tree. (Not that I know from experience or anything.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the New Year&rsquo;s and WDW Marathon crowds head home, it place feels hungover. The plus side of that is that the crowds are &lsquo;lethargic.&rsquo; The downside is that Christmas decorations are up long past the holiday&rsquo;s conclusion&ndash;to the point that they are awkward and overdue for removal. Weather can be cold, but it beats hot and humid!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Late&nbsp;</em>January, in particular, is one of our favorite times of the year at Walt Disney World. You get the low crowds, Christmas decorations are down, and the best chance at (slightly) improved weather.&nbsp;All things considered, January is still one of the better months to go, especially if you can avoid the MLK Day holiday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"walt-disney-world-fall-trip-report-535\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/walt-disney-world-fall-trip-report-535.jpg?resize=620%2C414\" style=\"height:414px; width:620px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/september-disney-world/\" target=\"_blank\">September</a></strong>&nbsp;&ndash; When judged solely on the basis of crowds, September is one of the better months of the year. Aside from Labor Day (which is actually less crowded than you expect), September&nbsp;is relatively slow, especially earlier in the month. Think of it as the calm before the storm that is October, with crowds getting heavier towards the end of the month. September also is the first full month of Halloween and Food &amp; Wine Festival seasons, which are definite plusses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The downside is the weather, but even that is trending in the right direction. Still, heat and humidity make&nbsp;being outdoors unpleasant, but it&rsquo;s still a high point in the storm season. It can be worth a roll of the dice to take advantage of those low crowds, especially later in the month. We&rsquo;ve had visits during September with incredibly pleasant weather and little rain. That&rsquo;s not the norm, but it can happen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/1109112531.jpg\"><img alt=\"Hall of Presidents\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/1109112531.jpg?resize=620%2C446\" style=\"height:446px; width:620px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/february-disney-world/\" target=\"_blank\">February</a></strong>&nbsp;&ndash; If late January is the better time of that month, it should follow that February is better than January. And it largely is, with the only exceptions being Super Bowl weekend (no, contrary to urban legend, the parks are&nbsp;<em>not&nbsp;</em>dead during the Super Bowl because &ldquo;everyone&rdquo; is watching television) and&nbsp;the week of Presidents&rsquo; Day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, crowds are slightly higher than January, but from our perspective, this is more than negated by the improved weather and the parks all having hit &ldquo;reset&rdquo; on the Christmas decorations. While it&rsquo;s not a good time to go in terms of seasonal events, it is a good time to see Walt Disney World in its &ldquo;unblemished&rdquo; state, without added decor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/walt-disney-world-christmas-pictures-034.jpg\"><img alt=\"walt-disney-world-christmas-pictures-034\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/walt-disney-world-christmas-pictures-034.jpg?resize=381%2C470\" style=\"height:470px; width:381px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/december-disney-world/\" target=\"_blank\">December</a></strong>&nbsp;&ndash; If Disney Vacation Club is the &ldquo;Best Kept Secret,&rdquo; the beginning of&nbsp;December being the best time&nbsp;to visit is &ldquo;Disney&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Second&nbsp;</em>Best Kept Secret.&rdquo; Unfortunately, there&rsquo;s just a pinch of sarcasm here. It&rsquo;s as if the both &lsquo;secrets&rsquo; were entrusted to Harvey Levin, and have been plastered everywhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately, the first week of December is not the respite from crowds that it once was. The secret has gotten out, and that coupled with Disney&rsquo;s more strategic use of blockout dates and dynamic ticket pricing has shifted crowds to the first week of December. Crowds are still nowhere near as bad as October or other peak seasons, but it&rsquo;s no longer the ghost town that it once was. We still view the first two weeks of the month as very desirable times to visit, even despite being about as &ldquo;secret&rdquo; as the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.in-n-out.com/menu/not-so-secret-menu.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">In-N-Out Secret Menu</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Low crowds and Christmas decorations &amp; entertainment are the big highlights here. The only thing keeping December out of the top slot is the hellacious crowds that descend upon Walt Disney World the week leading into Christmas and don&rsquo;t relent for the rest of the year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/walt-disney-world-christmas-pictures-055.jpg\"><img alt=\"walt-disney-world-christmas-pictures-055\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/walt-disney-world-christmas-pictures-055.jpg?resize=620%2C414\" style=\"height:414px; width:620px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.disneytouristblog.com/november-disney-world/\" target=\"_blank\">November</a></strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Save for Thanksgiving week and Jersey Week, neither of which are nearly as bad as the Christmas and New Year&rsquo;s holiday weeks in terms of crowds,&nbsp;<em>all</em>&nbsp;of November is pretty much like how early December used to be. Mid-November and the week after Thanksgiving both tend to have lower crowds than early December, which saw a fairly significant spike in crowds last year. We are predicting December 2018 will see similarly elevated crowds, whereas November should remain low to moderate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The other upsides to November are that the weather is generally more temperate (whereas December can be downright cold at times) and Food &amp; Wine Festival is ongoing. The biggest downside is that not all Christmas entertainment starts until after Thanksgiving, and some resort hotel decorations are not up until then.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, if low crowds and more temperate weather speak to you&ndash;and why wouldn&rsquo;t they&ndash;then it should be easy to see how November sneaks into the #1 spot on our list for months to visit Walt Disney World in 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/crowd-calendar-months-disney-world.jpg\"><img alt=\"crowd-calendar-months-disney-world\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.disneytouristblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/crowd-calendar-months-disney-world.jpg?resize=183%2C550\" style=\"height:550px; width:183px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The culmination of all of this? That&nbsp;<strong>our favorite week&nbsp;to visit Walt Disney World is the Sunday after Thanksgiving through&nbsp;the first Saturday of December</strong>. We think that&rsquo;s the sweet spot for the best prospects of good weather, low crowds, and seeing all Christmas decorations. (It also avoids Pop Warner.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If I were going for two additional trips, whether in a single year, span of years, or in my entire life, I would plan&nbsp;<strong>trip #2 the last week in September into the first week of October</strong>. This capitalizes on the low crowds of September while also increasing the odds of milder weather. It hits both Halloween and Food &amp; Wine seasons, and an added bonus is that October 1 is Magic Kingdom and Epcot&rsquo;s anniversary (although that will result in a slight spike in crowds), which is a neat experience during milestone years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>For week #3, I&rsquo;d do late February into early March</strong>. It&rsquo;s another&nbsp;opportunity to see the parks without a seasonal overlay (Flower &amp; Garden Festival will start towards the end of the trip, but that&rsquo;s just an overlay of pretty flowers), which is a nice change of pace. Aside from the Sunday after Thanksgiving timeframe (you do not want to start the trip any earlier than that), you can tweak&nbsp;the timeframes of these 3 sets of dates&nbsp;to fit your travel needs. Just don&rsquo;t tell anyone about these weeks. Let&rsquo;s try to keep this an&nbsp;<em>actual&nbsp;</em>secret.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Planning a Walt Disney World trip?
